# Experience New York City

## Making the World Smarter, Safer and Healthier



## Take a bite out of the Big Apple!

### All of New York City is your campus at the Katz School of Science and Health.





## Near Campus

Yeshiva University’s campuses provide easy access to what New York City has to offer: restaurants, pubs, shopping, exercise, art and entertainment.

**Arts and Culture** – New York City is home to many of the world’s premier museums, design houses, and performing arts centers, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art (“The Met”), the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), and the Whitney as well as smaller spaces such as the Neue Galerie, the Noguchi Museum, and New Museum. As a student, you’ll have access to discounted tickets for famous shows on Broadway, on-the-rise Off-Broadway shows, and experimental theatre Off-Off-Broadway.

**Food and Nightlife** – The city offers everything from hip and trendy bistros to cheap and cheerful cafes to organic and local open-air markets. Check out Coffee Shoppe, where all of the wait staff are former models, grab ramen at Ippudo, or a slice at John’s Pizza in Times Square. During our annual Restaurant Week, you can enjoy the prix-fixe menu at many of NYC’s finest restaurants for just $28.

**Sports and Fitness** – Run along the Hudson, bike around Manhattan to Brooklyn, or ride along the west side highway to the famous Cloisters, gym and fitness (as low as $10/month).





## Exploring the City

Each of New York City’s five boroughs — Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island — has its own unique flavor.

Every borough is a blend of new and old, innovation and history; there’s always something to do in the City That Never Sleeps! Check out  to learn more.

**The Bronx**– Cheer on the Yankees or spend a day at the famous Bronx Zoo.

**Brooklyn**– Enjoy the emerging arts culture, try unique restaurants like Pig Beach Burger, or take a walk across the historic Brooklyn Bridge.

**Staten Island**– Ride the (free!) ferry and hang out in some of the city’s greatest parks and beaches.

**Queens**– Hop on the subway to experience a different kind of cuisine at every stop in this richly diverse borough.

**Manhattan**– You don’t have to go far from campus for adventure. In our home borough, you can tour a skyscraper in the morning, eat a picnic lunch in Central Park, explore an art or history museum in the afternoon, and catch a Broadway show in the evening.





## And Beyond

If you want to get away from the buzz of the city, New York features some of the best hiking, skiing, and beaches on the East Coast.

From Yeshiva’s campus, you and your friends can make a trip to the star-studded Hamptons and spend the day on Montauk Beach. If you prefer the mountains, upstate New York is just a 90-minute bus ride from midtown. Enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and skiing in the Catskill Mountains or tour some of the quirky shops in New Paltz.

Breaks and long weekends are your chance to take in sights around the US starting with Washington DC and Boston. If your schedule and budget permits, Miami Beach is two-and-a-half-hour flight from NYC and LA, San Francisco, and the Grand Canyon can be done in five hours non-stop.

Gabby Tavory '25

OT Doctoral Student

I am originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA where I completed my undergraduate degree in speech-language pathology and linguistics from Temple University. I have experience working with children and risk assessment at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. My capstone project focuses on the resilience of children aged 2-5 years and their families through a tier 1 strength-based, educational training. My fieldwork experience has prepared me to take on this project by learning how to assess and formulate developmentally appropriate evidence-based treatment plans to promote desired outcomes in the population of both children and adults. In the future, I look forward to working in a hospital or outpatient clinic with at-risk populations.

Bella Chilczuk '25

OT Doctoral Student

As a Seattle, WA native, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington. I continued my education at the University College London where I received a Master's in Infancy and Early Childhood Development. There, I participated in research on the effects of the ketogenic diet on children with epilepsy to determine if children could remain seizure free after discontinuing the ketogenic diet. My interest in research continued as a research assistant at the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences. During my doctoral studies, my interests have included pediatric disability, parental education, and hand therapy.

Through my education I hope to cultivate an environment that is thoughtful, inclusive, and equitable for all my clients. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills while on the Family Resilience research team, looking into the effect of play on parental and child relationships.

Ruth Peer '25

OT Doctoral Student

Originally from Brooklyn, New York, I completed my undergraduate studies in Psychology at Brooklyn College. Prior to starting my doctorate, I volunteered in several outreach programs internationally and within the US that allowed me to experience working with a range of populations, including children from underprivileged communities and Holocaust survivors. Through my fieldwork experience as an OT student, I developed an interest in sensory integration and play, particularly with children who have cognitive, motor, and developmental disabilities. Being a student, I also gained an interest in understanding how to approach student mental health, specifically, students in medical health programs. I am excited to be a part of the student resilience team as it aligns with my interests in student mental health and helping others participate in meaningful activities to lead purposeful lives.

**Project Focus:** Student Resilience



Mayee Aboelenin '25

OT Doctoral Student

I am from Sayreville, New Jersey, and attended Rutgers University - Newark during my undergraduate studies, having pursued a major in Psychology and a minor in Biology. I learned a great deal from my coursework as well as partaking in research, some of which involved mental health, nutritional habits, and the state of well-being in adult populations. As an OT student, I am interested in inclusion and accessibility for all populations, the effects of purposeful activities on aging individuals, and emphasizing the importance of health in one’s development and related factors. My goal is to become an occupational therapist that brings something new to the table for underserved and general communities, and I believe that my presence in research will serve as a strong foundation.

I am happy to be part of the development of healthy aging and wellness intervention protocols for older adults facing social isolation. This research aligns with my background knowledge of different mental health conditions, and my interests in client education and the role of occupational therapy treatment in geriatric populations.

I am originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA where I completed my undergraduate degree in speech-language pathology and linguistics from Temple University. I have experience working with children and risk assessment at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. My capstone project focuses on the resilience of children aged 2-5 years and their families through a tier 1 strength-based, educational training. My fieldwork experience has prepared me to take on this project by learning how to assess and formulate developmentally appropriate evidence-based treatment plans to promote desired outcomes in the population of both children and adults. In the future, I look forward to working in a hospital or outpatient clinic with at-risk populations.

**Project Focus:** Family Resilience



Bella Chilczuk '25

OT Doctoral Student

As a Seattle, WA native, I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington. I continued my education at the University College London where I received a Master's in Infancy and Early Childhood Development. There, I participated in research on the effects of the ketogenic diet on children with epilepsy to determine if children could remain seizure free after discontinuing the ketogenic diet. My interest in research continued as a research assistant at the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences. During my doctoral studies, my interests have included pediatric disability, parental education, and hand therapy.

Through my education I hope to cultivate an environment that is thoughtful, inclusive, and equitable for all my clients. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills while on the Family Resilience research team, looking into the effect of play on parental and child relationships.

**Project Focus:** Family Resilience



Ruth Peer '25

OT Doctoral Student

Originally from Brooklyn, New York, I completed my undergraduate studies in Psychology at Brooklyn College. Prior to starting my doctorate, I volunteered in several outreach programs internationally and within the US that allowed me to experience working with a range of populations, including children from underprivileged communities and Holocaust survivors. Through my fieldwork experience as an OT student, I developed an interest in sensory integration and play, particularly with children who have cognitive, motor, and developmental disabilities. Being a student, I also gained an interest in understanding how to approach student mental health, specifically, students in medical health programs. I am excited to be a part of the student resilience team as it aligns with my interests in student mental health and helping others participate in meaningful activities to lead purposeful lives.

**Project Focus:** Student Resilience



Mayee Aboelenin '25

OT Doctoral Student

I am from Sayreville, New Jersey, and attended Rutgers University - Newark during my undergraduate studies, having pursued a major in Psychology and a minor in Biology. I learned a great deal from my coursework as well as partaking in research, some of which involved mental health, nutritional habits, and the state of well-being in adult populations. As an OT student, I am interested in inclusion and accessibility for all populations, the effects of purposeful activities on aging individuals, and emphasizing the importance of health in one’s development and related factors. My goal is to become an occupational therapist that brings something new to the table for underserved and general communities, and I believe that my presence in research will serve as a strong foundation.

I am happy to be part of the development of healthy aging and wellness intervention protocols for older adults facing social isolation. This research aligns with my background knowledge of different mental health conditions, and my interests in client education and the role of occupational therapy treatment in geriatric populations.

**Project Focus:** Healthy Aging

#### OT Specialists Aim to Improve Child Development Through Healthy Play

As the COVID-19 pandemic and poverty-related stress increase the need for social-emotional support for children and families, a team of specialists led by Katz School professor Amiya Waldman-Levi has created a strength-based intervention program that aims to improve children’s development through playful interactions with their parents.

The program, Promoting Health Through Play Opportunities (originally Playing Playfully Teacher Group Training Program but renamed when parents and parent-child OT sessions were added) seeks to foster the ability of parents and children to improve their use of coping skills and overall resilience in the face of adversity. Specifically, the program provides tools for helping parents become change agents in their child’s life through the promotion of healthy play opportunities within the family.

#### Healthy Aging: A Wellness Intervention Program

There is evidence that social-emotional factors contribute to older adults’ engagement and satisfaction in life despite a decline in physical and mental health as they age. This collaborative project between the Occupational Therapy program at Mercy College and the Katz School’s Occupational Therapy Doctorate program will test the effectiveness of health, aging and wellness (HAW) group programs.

The research team will conduct a pilot study comparing in-person and remote delivery of the HAW programs for older adults living independently in a community. The program combines yoga, hope theory and mindfulness to support physical, mental and emotional aging in place. This work builds on a preliminary study in which the researchers found that the newly developed HAW program had a positive impact on older adults’ sense of hope.

#### Using Probability to Design Engaging Video Games

Designing a great video game is a balancing act, especially in strategy games where the thrill often comes from tackling the unexpected. Whether it’s an enemy ambush or a rare loot drop, the element of surprise keeps players on their toes. But too much randomness can feel unfair, while too little can make a game predictable and boring. Enter the world of probability-driven game design, a method that introduces structured uncertainty into gameplay. A new framework introduced by Katz School researchers uses mathematical tools to strike this balance, creating levels that are not only engaging but varied and challenging.

But too much randomness can feel unfair, while too little can make a game predictable and boring. Enter the world of probability-driven game design, a method that introduces structured uncertainty into gameplay. A new framework introduced by Katz School researchers uses mathematical tools to strike this balance, creating levels that are not only engaging but varied and challenging.

## Making the World Smarter, Safer and Healthier











## State-of-the-Art Labs

In our bright, spacious, state-of-the-art labs, occupational therapy students gain hands-on experience with specialized tools and equipment, practice and simulate interventions, and build the skills they need to become expert practitioners.





## Modalities Lab

The Modalities Lab is fully equipped with adjustable desks, chairs and mats, and a range of thermal and electrical modalities and orthotic fabrication equipment. It can be transformed for use across a variety of OT courses, including anatomy, splinting, assistive technology and physical agent modalities. Students may explore movement patterns on the mats; apply hot or cold packs, or use the fluidized therapy or electrical stimulation modalities; and create hand splints or perform wheelchair evaluations.





## Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Lab

The ADL Lab is a simulated apartment, complete with a full bathroom, bed and living room, and kitchen and laundry. Students practice interventions with clients in their natural home environment, helping them to safely access the toilet, shower and tub; get in and out of bed; and prepare and eat meals safely and effectively, using adapted methods or equipment.





## Neurosensory Lab

This unique Neurosensory Lab includes suspension equipment for students to experience and practice common interventions for children with sensory and other developmental issues. The suspended swings and other play equipment help children develop muscle strength, neurological modulation and other skills to fully participate at play and in school.

#### Probing Connection Between Bending Light and Its Atomic Origin

New paper by physics chair Dr. Fredy Zypman considers the the atomic origin of refraction.

#### Probing Connection Between Bending Light and Its Atomic Origin

In his paper, “Permittivity from First Principles,” published in September by , Dr. Zypman considers the explicit connection between refraction and its atomic origin and proposes a mathematical model to gain physical insight on permittivity, a property related to refraction.

Refraction occurs when light moves from one substance to another, changing speed and direction. The index of refraction is the relationship between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in a substance. “Matter around us—in plastics, liquids, our skin, the air—have characteristic electrical properties,” said Dr. Zypman. “When the electrical field travels from one medium to another, light must adjust to the local environment. That’s why we see shadows and reflections—those rich sources of optical sensations—all around us.”

“We aimed to produce a clear conceptual pathway between the atomic polarization and the familiar refraction,” he said, “The main focus of the study is to produce exact expressions for the permittivity to all orders of an electric field that is valid for any intensity of light, and to compute the permittivity for typical materials.”

#### Occupational Therapy Research Addresses Societal Needs

While the core function of an occupational therapist is to help people live their lives to the fullest by supporting their independence, the Katz School’s  takes that mission a step further by asking students to consider the wider implications of their scholarship—to fill an urgent societal need or a gap in the academic literature. At a recent Capstone Dissemination Day, the results of that programmatic effort were vividly on display.

Seven projects were presented by eight recently graduated OT doctoral students. Research-oriented projects included the impact of manual dexterity on the cognition of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (Dr. Rinu Abraham); promoting student resiliency and academic performance (Dr. Noah Frydman); and the development of standardized educational modules to ensure the integrity of researchers (Dr. Deena Motechin and Dr. Avani Patel).

Projects involving the development of programs or education modules to meet the needs of different populations or communities included a toolkit for people suffering from spinal cord injuries and disease (Dr. Rachel Buckley); the development of a fall prevention program for senior citizens (Dr. Judy Chalouh-Benjamin); a protocol using mindfulness and leisure for adults with disabilities (Dr. Gavi Gordon); and a culturally informed aging-in-place program for underserved adults (Dr. Ebony Sneed-Knight).

Read more about the project



#### Two-Step Verification System Using Face Recognition

**Research Presentation:** Two-Step Verification System Using Face Recognition

**Presented by:** Mukilan Narayanamoorthy — M.S. in Cybersecurity

**Abstract:** As technology use increases rapidly across the globe, the number of active social media users has reached 3.7 billion within just the past three years. This increasing demand urges social network companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of the user. Several companies have introduced two-step verification mechanisms, like verification codes and graphical passwords, but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques, like SIM hijacking. To identify a more secure environment, we researched three approaches—aHash, pHash and dHash—to determine which offers the greatest protection of authenticity. Our findings suggest that dHash is the best approach, and one can use the combination of facial recognition and cryptography to safely ensure the authenticity of the user.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data

**Research Presentation:** Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data

**Presented by:** Benjamin Cohen —M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization

**Abstract:** Traditionally, audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms. In the past few years, however, a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process easier. This project applies deep-learning methods to speech-emotion recognition (the ability to discern a person’s emotions solely from their tone of voice). To do this, we gathered a base dataset of around 1,400 audio clips, labeled as angry or not angry, augmented the dataset using a generative model and then used transfer learning with a pre-trained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not, ultimately achieving accuracy of greater than 90 percent. This work is important because it shows that deep-learning approaches work very well with audio data and that not much data is needed because it's possible to augment datasets.

#### Strategies for Developing and Commercializing New Cancer Treatment

**Research Presentation:** Strategies for the Development and Commercialization of an Antibody-Drug Conjugate as a New Therapy for Solid Tumors of Hypopharyngeal Cancer

**Presented by:** Anam Khalid — M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Abstract:** Grit Bio seeks to transform healthcare for oncology patients by developing safer cancer therapeutics. Grit Bio is focused on treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with a priority on a rare type of throat cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, which is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has a very poor prognosis. Grit Bio’s strategy is to target dormant cancer cells to prevent recurrent cancer. The company is developing two products, a peptide inhibitor and an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), both targeting a specific metabolic process in dormant cancer cells. This project focuses on one product, the novel ADC (LIGRECA, pronounced lig-re-sa). The project aims to assist the company in understanding the market potential and commercialization feasibility of LIGRECA via market analysis and risk assessment and proposes a risk-mitigation strategy for the successful development of new ADC as new therapy for solid tumors, based on the market of hypopharyngeal and exemplified by two FDA approved ADCs used for solid tumors (PADCEV and KADCYLA TDM-1).



#### Force-Indentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects

#### Force-Indentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects

**Research Presentation:** Force-Indentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects

**Presented by:** Benjamin Goykadosh — M.A. in Physics

**Abstract:** Currently, there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells. These methods, however, are computationally slow and require intensive testing outside of the body. In this project, we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force versus indentation curves produced by the deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope, which is necessary to understand cell contraction and deformation. The theory depends on parameters, such as Young’s modulus, object length and Poisson’s ratio, and is obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force versus indentation curves. Thus, our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters, in general, but particularly in a soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and where their properties are often dependent on external stresses.

**Research Presentation:** Adbot: Integrated Communications Go To Market Plan

**Presented by:** Hannah Kraitberg, Tomer Mendler, Linyu Zhen, Panxinyue Zhang, and Jingyuan Wang —M.S in Digital Marketing and Media

**Abstract:** In this collaborative project, the Katz School's digital marketing and media team developed a comprehensive brand and marketing strategy for Adbot, a startup company aiming to change the way YouTube creators monetize. The resulting strategy leverages deep-customer and competitor insights, as well as the company’s business purpose and differentiators. The strategy also combines all relevant marketing channels. It provides a roadmap to steer Adbot’s successful brand development and a clear framework for reaching Adbot’s target audience, including details on planned activity and the relevant methods of communication.

#### A Proposed Novel Drug Treatment of Actinic Keratosis

**Research Presentation:** A Proposed Novel Two-Drug Combination Topical Treatment of Actinic Keratosis

**Presented by:** Jonathan Taub — M.S. in Biotechnology Management & Entrepreneurship

**Abstract:** Actinic keratosis (AK) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) incidences have increased exponentially over the last half-century, even as methods of diagnosis and diagnostic definitions themselves remain malleable. An estimated two-thirds of all AK and cSCC patients are over the age of 65, possibly presenting a public health concern. One group of AK and cSCC sufferers that might find themselves with more restricted options in a crowded therapeutic field are immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with transplants. GritBIO proposes a combination of two drugs—miltefosine and carmofur—in a novel composition for topical administration, which would provide the requisite cytotoxicity without the attendant adverse effects on immune cells. This project aims to understand the market, IP constrains, regulatory requirements and the potential for fast-track designation for this treatment.

#### Capture the Flag

**Research Presentation:** Capture the Flag

**Presented by:** Kevin Suckiel — M.S. in Cybersecurity

**Research Presentation:** In the classroom, technical skills can sometimes be overshadowed by theoretical knowledge. Capture the Flag (CTF) events remove those barriers by allowing students to use any tools in their arsenal to complete challenges related to the subject matter. CTF challenges range in difficulty and give students a snapshot of problems they may face in the real world. To test the effectiveness of CTF events in facilitating cybersecurity skills development, 40 students were asked to participate in CTF events across several categories. The outcome, based on student feedback, suggests that students learned more when engaged with CTF events and felt better prepared to handle real-life cybersecurity opportunities and challenges.

**Research Presentation:** Financial Impact of Tropical Cyclones on U.S. Real Estate Sector

**Presented by:** Atreish V. Ramlakhan, Aishwarya Singh, and Brian Livian — M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and M.A. in Mathematics

**Abstract:** This project seeks to quantify the financial effects of tropical cyclones on the U.S. real estate market. The project is a collaboration between students in the Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics programs at the Katz School of Science and Health and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Using hurricane data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as proprietary real estate trust data from S&P databases, we analyzed the growing impact of tropical cyclones in the United States to show the relationship between increased hurricane frequency due to climate change and the financial losses of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT).

#### Regulation of Testicular Sertoli Cell by SUMOylation

**Research Presentation:** Regulation of Testicular Sertoli Cell by SUMOylation

**Presented by:** Shanza Baseer and Manveet Singh Nanda — M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Abstract:** SUMO proteins are essential for normal development and are expressed in mouse and human Sertoli cells. However, the cell-specific role of sumoylation in those cells has only started to be elucidated. In other cell types, including granulosa cells, sumoylation is regulated by a SUMO ligase KAP1/Trim28. Deletion of KAP1 in Sertoli cells causes testicular degeneration, but the role of KAP1 in those cells has not been identified. In addition, the molecular regulation of Sertoli cells and their crosstalk with germ cells has not been fully characterized. Here, we show that both mouse and human Sertoli undergo apoptosis upon inhibition of sumoylation with a chemical inhibitor or via a siRNA technology. We have additionally detected changes in the Sertoli cell proteome upon the inhibition of sumoylation, and our data suggest that among others, the expression of ER/stress-related proteins is highly affected by this inhibition. Sumoylation may also regulate the NOTCH signaling which is important for the maintenance of the developing germ cells. Furthermore, we show that a siRNA-down-regulation of KAP1 in a Sertoli-derived cell line causes an almost complete inactivation of sumoylation. In conclusion, sumoylation regulates important survival and signaling pathways in Sertoli cells, and KAP1 can be a major regulator of sumoylation in these cells.

#### Two-Step Verification System Using Face Recognition

**Research Presentation:** Two-Step Verification System Using Face Recognition

**Presented by:** Mukilan Narayanamoorthy — M.S. in Cybersecurity

**Abstract:** As technology use increases rapidly across the globe, the number of active social media users has reached 3.7 billion within just the past three years. This increasing demand urges social network companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of the user. Several companies have introduced two-step verification mechanisms, like verification codes and graphical passwords, but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques, like SIM hijacking. To identify a more secure environment, we researched three approaches—aHash, pHash and dHash—to determine which offers the greatest protection of authenticity. Our findings suggest that dHash is the best approach, and one can use the combination of facial recognition and cryptography to safely ensure the authenticity of the user.

#### Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data

**Research Presentation:** Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data

**Presented by:** Benjamin Cohen —M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization

**Abstract:** Traditionally, audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms. In the past few years, however, a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process easier. This project applies deep-learning methods to speech-emotion recognition (the ability to discern a person’s emotions solely from their tone of voice). To do this, we gathered a base dataset of around 1,400 audio clips, labeled as angry or not angry, augmented the dataset using a generative model and then used transfer learning with a pre-trained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not, ultimately achieving accuracy of greater than 90 percent. This work is important because it shows that deep-learning approaches work very well with audio data and that not much data is needed because it's possible to augment datasets.

#### Strategies for Developing and Commercializing New Cancer Treatment

**Research Presentation:** Strategies for the Development and Commercialization of an Antibody-Drug Conjugate as a New Therapy for Solid Tumors of Hypopharyngeal Cancer

**Presented by:** Anam Khalid — M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Abstract:** Grit Bio seeks to transform healthcare for oncology patients by developing safer cancer therapeutics. Grit Bio is focused on treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with a priority on a rare type of throat cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, which is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has a very poor prognosis. Grit Bio’s strategy is to target dormant cancer cells to prevent recurrent cancer. The company is developing two products, a peptide inhibitor and an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), both targeting a specific metabolic process in dormant cancer cells. This project focuses on one product, the novel ADC (LIGRECA, pronounced lig-re-sa). The project aims to assist the company in understanding the market potential and commercialization feasibility of LIGRECA via market analysis and risk assessment and proposes a risk-mitigation strategy for the successful development of new ADC as new therapy for solid tumors, based on the market of hypopharyngeal and exemplified by two FDA approved ADCs used for solid tumors (PADCEV and KADCYLA TDM-1).

#### Force-Indentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects

**Research Presentation:** Force-Indentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects

**Presented by:** Benjamin Goykadosh — M.A. in Physics

**Abstract:** Currently, there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells. These methods, however, are computationally slow and require intensive testing outside of the body. In this project, we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force versus indentation curves produced by the deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope, which is necessary to understand cell contraction and deformation. The theory depends on parameters, such as Young’s modulus, object length and Poisson’s ratio, and is obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force versus indentation curves. Thus, our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters, in general, but particularly in a soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and where their properties are often dependent on external stresses.

#### A Proposed Novel Drug Treatment of Actinic Keratosis

**Research Presentation:** A Proposed Novel Two-Drug Combination Topical Treatment of Actinic Keratosis

**Presented by:** Jonathan Taub — M.S. in Biotechnology Management & Entrepreneurship

**Abstract:** Actinic keratosis (AK) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) incidences have increased exponentially over the last half-century, even as methods of diagnosis and diagnostic definitions themselves remain malleable. An estimated two-thirds of all AK and cSCC patients are over the age of 65, possibly presenting a public health concern. One group of AK and cSCC sufferers that might find themselves with more restricted options in a crowded therapeutic field are immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with transplants.

### **Lab to Life: The Path to Successful Biotechnology Commercialization**

**Author:** Anton Papa, M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Faculty Advisor:** Nilam Sinha, Ph.D., Albert Einstein College of Medicine



**Abstract:** Important biotechnology inventions that promise to improve the quality of life often fail to make it to market due to stakeholders facing numerous challenges related to regulatory hurdles, funding constraints and intellectual property rights. In partnership with Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Office of Biotechnology and Business Development, this project explores the commercialization potential and requirements for three novel biotechnology inventions: 1) a storage and preservation solution that minimizes damage and prolongs function of donated biological tissue and organs (Project C-00001470); 2) a precision, small-molecule therapy for patients with Type I Diabetes (Project C-00001455); and 3) a small-molecule cancer therapeutic that targets RICTOR for brain metastasis from lung cancers and overcomes anti-EGFR drug resistance (Project C-00001352). The project includes outlining the commercialization strategy for each technology, including reviewing intellectual property and invention disclosure provided by the primary investigator, drafting of non-confidential marketing summaries, market research, identifying potential licensing partners, and drafting marketing campaigns. In addition, this project also provides valuable insights of the technology transfer lifecycle for investors and stakeholders interested in the commercialization of biotech inventions.

### **Addressing Emotional Regulation Through Interoception for Clinicians and Parents**

**Author:** Arielle Nyenty, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Interoception, which describes the concept of feeling, grasping and understanding one’s internal bodily sensations, plays a vital role in defining emotional regulation (ER) in early childhood and throughout life. Current research considers interoception a foundational component of effective ER, which was a concern for parents at My Kids Therapy, an occupational therapy sensory gym for children. The purpose of this project was to provide an alternative, evidence-based method for occupational therapists at My Kids Therapy to assess and address ER in children ages 4 to 6 through measuring and developing their interoception. Outcomes included the development of an interoception accuracy (IA) screening tool for clinicians to use with their clients, resources for parents and caregivers to address IA and ER in their homes, and a body-emotion diagram visually demonstrating the effect of interoception on ER to be used by clinicians, parents and families.

### **Forgive but Don’t Forget: Lessons Learned from the Paycheck Protection Program**

**Author:** Avi Skidelsky, M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization

**Faculty Advisors:** Andrew Catlin and James Topor, M.S.



**Abstract:** The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure, many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules. The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1% interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years. At the time of writing, the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85% of applicants totaling over $100 billion. Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program, the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud, this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request, using sampling techniques and machine learning methods. Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process. Instead, the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness.

### **Navier-Stokes Numerical Simulation of Vortices in the Compressible Gas Flow**

**Author:** Ellie Austin, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Antonella Marini, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science. The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the Couette-Taylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the Navier-Stokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package. The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders. The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder, and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature. Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature. With increasing Reynolds number values, the vortex density increased, reaching a certain level, then sharply decreased. A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature.

### **Evidence-Based Resources to Support Independence in Children and Young Adults with Physical Disabilities** ​

**Author:** Erin McGuire, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Mentor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L

**Abstract:** Students with cerebral palsy (CP) and other neuromuscular disorders place higher demands on classroom staff than their typically developing peers. CP is a neuromuscular condition that may result in impaired movement that is associated with exaggerated reflexes, floppiness or spasticity of the limbs and trunk, unusual posture, involuntary movements and unsteady walking. These characteristics may make it difficult for students with CP to function independently throughout the school day, leading to high dependency on classroom staff. Many students at CP Association of Nassau County (CP Nassau), a school catering to individuals with physical disabilities, require mobility and adaptive equipment, sensory equipment and custom hand splints, and classroom staff need to be well-versed in using this complex equipment. Conducted in collaboration with the Occupational Therapy Department at CP Nassau, this project aimed to identify staff needs and develop resources to aid them in supporting their students throughout the school day. Fifteen evidence-based training videos were created using a video modeling approach that can be accessed easily throughout the school day via a scannable QR Code. This training offers an accessible model that occupational therapists can adapt to fill similar gaps in knowledge among teachers and other staff.

### **Play and Arts-Based Program for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder**

**Author:** Harlee Feldman, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers. Additionally, art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity, social-emotional, language and cognitive skills. Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because it works with the strengths of this population, such as attention to detail, while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population, such as cognitive flexibility. The project included the development of a play- and arts-based program, with the goal of increasing the self-esteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD. Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high self-esteem and good social skills.

### **Identifying the Gap: Clients Denied/Delayed Early Intervention Speech and Language Services Due to New CDC Milestones**

**Author:** Jillian Rossi, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisors:** Marissa Barrera, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Michaela Medved, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control changed the developmental milestones for children from birth to 3 years old; it was the first change in over two decades. The modification included delaying selected speech and language milestones by six months. This decision yields a range of ramifications for young children and their families. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of children whose qualification for early intervention (EI) speech and language services will be delayed or denied as a result of the new guidelines; and the length of time children would be delayed receiving EI speech and language services in order to identify contributing risk factors for communication disorders and overall development. The study involved a survey of 63 speech-language pathologists who were asked to consider EI clients who just missed or met their milestones. The survey revealed that 49% of clients qualified for services later than they would have with the older developmental milestones. This study concluded that the new developmental milestones resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for clients.

### **Paternal Reflective Functioning and Its Impact on Joint Play**

**Author:** Julie Gurgova, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisors:** Amber Cope, Ph.D. candidate, LIU; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L, Katz School; Sara Haden, Ph.D., LIU



**Abstract:** Reflective functioning (RF) is the ability of a parent to understand and be more aware of their own internal mental state, thoughts and reasoning. It is unclear if RF influences joint play between fathers and sons, so the purpose of the study was to examine if fathers with higher RF are more supportive in their play with their sons compared to fathers who have both a lower RF and a higher endorsement of traditional masculine ideology. Twenty English-speaking, predominately married Caucasian fathers of typically developing sons ages 3 to 9 were recruited for the study. Videos of 15-minute, joint-play sessions recorded at home were analyzed using the Parent Support of Child Playfulness Scale. Surveys were given using the Male Role Norms Inventory-Revised scale and the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. An analysis revealed a significant correlation between a father's higher RF and a lower view of traditional masculinity ideology, and vice versa. Results also indicated no significant correlation between the father’s RF and support provided to his son during joint play.

### **A Multifaceted, Interactive, Child Development Toolkit for Jewish Parents**

**Author:** Miriam Graham, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Mindy Garfinkel, OTD, OTR/L



**Abstract:** Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a child's development and, therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges parents to monitor developmental milestones. However, the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities, including the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, due to their insular culture. An innovative, andragogy-based method to educate young ultra-Orthodox Jewish mothers, who spend significant time caring for their children, about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial. The purpose of this project is to create a children’s book, which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones. This dual-narration style is an effective way to educate parents, since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their co-occupation of spending time with their children.

### **Does Increased Technology Use by Parents and Caregivers Impact the Social Language Skills of Developing Children?**

**Author:** Molly Hampton, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisor:** Troy Dargin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP



**Abstract:** Over the last decade, technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world. This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old. The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parent/caretaker behavior have on children's language skills and behavior, as well as the impact of increased technology use on children’s development in these areas. The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness. This, in turn, could negatively impact the child's social language skills. More in-depth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on children’s developmental skills.

> ""There are a bunch of guidelines on how much screen time children should use. However, I’m hoping this research gives parents a guideline for their own technology use—because parents’ screen time really does affect their children.

### **Modeling Complex Hand Grasps Using Muscle Activity of Movement Primitives**

**Author:** Natania Birnbaum, M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Faculty Advisor:** Sai Praveen Kadiyala, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Motor function of the hands is often lost as the result of a stroke and is difficult to restore, which has a detrimental effect on stroke survivors' ability to perform everyday tasks. Many methods exist to assist survivors in rehabilitation, but those based on surface electromyography (sEMG) hold promise due to their flexibility of placement, ease of data collection and patient comfort, and cost-effectiveness and increased patient motivation. A myoelectric exoskeleton controlled by sEMG sensors on the muscles of a patient's arm can be used in upper-limb rehabilitation therapy. In this work, we aim to model complex grasps belonging to activities of daily living (ADL) using simple movement primitives of upper arm and validate on a low-cost test bed. We collected sEMG data of five movement primitives and tried to model 10 grasps which are a part of ADL. A multiple linear regression applied on grasp and movement primitive data showed that some of the primitives had more of an impact on the model than others and that the gestures had an inconsistent effect on the model across multiple trials. Replication of both movement primitives and complex grasps on our test bed was conducted successfully.

### **Brief Expository on Arnold Diffusion in Dissipative Systems**

**Author:** Samuel W. Akingbade, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Marian Gidea, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** A Hamiltonian system is a mathematical model for mechanical systems obeying the law of conservation of energy. When a perturbation is added to the system, the energy is not necessarily conserved, for instance, it may evolve randomly or even decay. We are interested in systems for which, despite the perturbation, we can obtain energy growth. Specifically, we consider a pendulum-rotator system coupled with a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, and with an additional damping perturbation. For this system, we prove the existence of diffusing orbits where the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. This work extends the celebrated Arnold diffusion conjecture to the case of Hamiltonian systems with small dissipation.

A full paper based on this work has been accepted for publication in the _SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems_, publication pending.

**Authors:** Sayanto Pal and Shaye Weinstein, M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship; Margarita Vigodner, Ph.D., Stern College for Women, Yeshiva University



**Abstract:** In a considerable majority of male infertility cases, the underlying component has not been discovered. SUMOylation (post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers or SUMO proteins) has emerged as a crucial regulating event in several developmental processes, including reproduction. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SUMOylation arrests meiosis and affects expression and phosphorylation of several proteins. In order to confirm some of the identified targets and better comprehend the mechanisms regulated by SUMO in germ cells, SUMOylation cycle was down-regulated using inhibitors like Ginkgolic acid (GA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. The effect of the inhibition on the expression level and phosphorylation status of several proteins regulating meiosis and spermatogenesis, like Nucleophosmin (NPM), heterogenous ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) and Valosine containing protein (VCP), were studied using gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Results confirmed the down-regulation of these proteins upon inhibition of SUMOylation, suggesting the importance of their regulation during spermatogenesis. This finding underscores the significance of characterizing new proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate spermatogenesis.

### **Investigating Brain Injury in Domestic Violence Survivors and Individuals with Substance Misuse**

**Author:** Sheila Vousoghian, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L

**Abstract:** While there is ample research on the physical and psychological impacts of traumatic brain injuries and on the benefits of early identification and intervention in preventing lifelong complications from them, there is a lack of awareness of traumatic brain injury among domestic violence survivors and individuals with substance misuse. As a result, individuals who face domestic violence and substance misuse may not know they have or are not diagnosed with TBI, leading to diminished health outcomes. With the goal of increasing awareness, this project involved creating a full set of course materials that will be used as part of an online certification course to train domestic violence organizations on screening for traumatic brain injury; and creating and distributing a fact sheet on substance misuse and traumatic brain injury with the goal of early intervention. These interventions will increase awareness as substance misuse and domestic violence facilities become more familiar with the signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury.

**Author:** Sophia Klass, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisor:** Troy Dargin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP



**Abstract:** This literature review compares the performance of school-age bilingual (English-Spanish) speakers to their monolingual peers in science and math classes. These courses were chosen due to the specific semantics (vocabulary) required to comprehend scientific and mathematical theories. This specialized vocabulary eliminates the possibility of monolingual students using their prior English-based lexicon as an advantage. The review involved analyzing numerous studies that evaluated how school-age bilingual (English-Spanish) students performed on assessments in comparison to their monolingual peers. Due to their complex level of cognitive functioning, the reviewed studies show that English-Spanish bilingual students performed the same and, in some cases, better on classroom assessments in science compared with their monolingual peers. Further research is needed to evaluate bilingual students’ performance in math. Educators, speech-language pathologists and inter-professional collaborators who work with bilingual children may be able to leverage bilingual students’ cognitive strengths when developing educational and therapeutic interventions, as well as visual supports and prompts, for this population.

**Abstract:** This study explored the use of the Constructing Triangle Method (CTM) to solve trigonometric differential equations. CTM is a geometric method that involves constructing a triangle to represent the given trigonometric function and its derivatives. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of CTM by solving the trigonometric differential equation du/dt = cosu(t). We compared the solutions obtained by CTM with those obtained by other methods, such as separation of variables, substitution and integrating factors. Our results showed that CTM is a powerful method for solving trigonometric differential equations. It provides a clear geometric interpretation of the solution, which is easy to understand and visualize. Furthermore, it reduces the complexity of the problem by transforming it into a simpler geometric problem.

**Authors:** Yonah Moise and Yedidya Moise, B.A./M.A. in Mathematics

**Faculty Advisor:** Jeremy Schiff, Ph.D., Bar-Ilan University



**Abstract:** The Nonlinear Schrodinger equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose principal application is to the propagation of a beam of light. Saturated nonlinearity acts as a limitation on the nonlinear component of the equation to prevent it from blowing up. After reproducing initial conditions from Gatz and Herrmann (1997), which are based on certain constraints, the split-step method was applied to step forward in time and approximate the solution to this PDE for any given time. We then constructed a Gaussian function of two dimensions (with a power equivalent to the power of the solution) and ran the split-step method on this function to study it as an approximation of the solution. The observed two internal modes in the behavior of the widths, as well as other observed behavior, provide a basis for analysis of this approximate solution.

**Author:** Yonathan Magendzo, B.A./M.A. in Physics

**Faculty Advisor:** Fredy Zypman, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Detection of traces of iron in the brain is useful for medical applications. Different tissues possessing different magnetic permeabilities expose themselves via small spatial variations of the magnetic field during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data acquisition and image analysis methods that visualize spatial distributions of magnetic permeabilities are known as quantitative permeability mapping. The permeabilities are found through local distortions in all components of the magnetic field. However, most modern techniques of MRI model the brain as a collection of magnetic dipoles and, therefore, only the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is assessable to MRI. An MRI machine doesn't have enough information to map the permeabilities. To address this problem, we developed an algorithm that can map the permeabilities only needing the longitudinal component of the magnetic field.

**Abstract:** Important biotechnology inventions that promise to improve the quality of life often fail to make it to market due to stakeholders facing numerous challenges related to regulatory hurdles, funding constraints and intellectual property rights. In partnership with Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Office of Biotechnology and Business Development, this project explores the commercialization potential and requirements for three novel biotechnology inventions: 1) a storage and preservation solution that minimizes damage and prolongs function of donated biological tissue and organs (Project C-00001470); 2) a precision, small-molecule therapy for patients with Type I Diabetes (Project C-00001455); and 3) a small-molecule cancer therapeutic that targets RICTOR for brain metastasis from lung cancers and overcomes anti-EGFR drug resistance (Project C-00001352). The project includes outlining the commercialization strategy for each technology, including reviewing intellectual property and invention disclosure provided by the primary investigator, drafting of non-confidential marketing summaries, market research, identifying potential licensing partners, and drafting marketing campaigns. In addition, this project also provides valuable insights of the technology transfer lifecycle for investors and stakeholders interested in the commercialization of biotech inventions.

### **Addressing Emotional Regulation Through Interoception for Clinicians and Parents**

**Author:** Arielle Nyenty, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Interoception, which describes the concept of feeling, grasping and understanding one’s internal bodily sensations, plays a vital role in defining emotional regulation (ER) in early childhood and throughout life. Current research considers interoception a foundational component of effective ER, which was a concern for parents at My Kids Therapy, an occupational therapy sensory gym for children. The purpose of this project was to provide an alternative, evidence-based method for occupational therapists at My Kids Therapy to assess and address ER in children ages 4 to 6 through measuring and developing their interoception. Outcomes included the development of an interoception accuracy (IA) screening tool for clinicians to use with their clients, resources for parents and caregivers to address IA and ER in their homes, and a body-emotion diagram visually demonstrating the effect of interoception on ER to be used by clinicians, parents and families.

**Faculty Advisors:** Andrew Catlin and James Topor, M.S.



**Abstract:** The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure, many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules. The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1% interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years. At the time of writing, the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85% of applicants totaling over $100 billion. Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program, the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud, this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request, using sampling techniques and machine learning methods. Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process. Instead, the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness.

**Author:** Ellie Austin, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Antonella Marini, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science. The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the Couette-Taylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the Navier-Stokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package. The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders. The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder, and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature. Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature. With increasing Reynolds number values, the vortex density increased, reaching a certain level, then sharply decreased. A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature.

### **Evidence-Based Resources to Support Independence in Children and Young Adults with Physical Disabilities** ​

**Author:** Erin McGuire, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Mentor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L

**Abstract:** Students with cerebral palsy (CP) and other neuromuscular disorders place higher demands on classroom staff than their typically developing peers. CP is a neuromuscular condition that may result in impaired movement that is associated with exaggerated reflexes, floppiness or spasticity of the limbs and trunk, unusual posture, involuntary movements and unsteady walking. These characteristics may make it difficult for students with CP to function independently throughout the school day, leading to high dependency on classroom staff. Many students at CP Association of Nassau County (CP Nassau), a school catering to individuals with physical disabilities, require mobility and adaptive equipment, sensory equipment and custom hand splints, and classroom staff need to be well-versed in using this complex equipment. Conducted in collaboration with the Occupational Therapy Department at CP Nassau, this project aimed to identify staff needs and develop resources to aid them in supporting their students throughout the school day. Fifteen evidence-based training videos were created using a video modeling approach that can be accessed easily throughout the school day via a scannable QR Code. This training offers an accessible model that occupational therapists can adapt to fill similar gaps in knowledge among teachers and other staff.

### **Play and Arts-Based Program for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder**

**Author:** Harlee Feldman, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers. Additionally, art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity, social-emotional, language and cognitive skills. Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because it works with the strengths of this population, such as attention to detail, while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population, such as cognitive flexibility. The project included the development of a play- and arts-based program, with the goal of increasing the self-esteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD. Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high self-esteem and good social skills.

**Author:** Jillian Rossi, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisors:** Marissa Barrera, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Michaela Medved, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control changed the developmental milestones for children from birth to 3 years old; it was the first change in over two decades. The modification included delaying selected speech and language milestones by six months. This decision yields a range of ramifications for young children and their families. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of children whose qualification for early intervention (EI) speech and language services will be delayed or denied as a result of the new guidelines; and the length of time children would be delayed receiving EI speech and language services in order to identify contributing risk factors for communication disorders and overall development. The study involved a survey of 63 speech-language pathologists who were asked to consider EI clients who just missed or met their milestones. The survey revealed that 49% of clients qualified for services later than they would have with the older developmental milestones. This study concluded that the new developmental milestones resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for clients.

**Author:** Julie Gurgova, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisors:** Amber Cope, Ph.D. candidate, LIU; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L, Katz School; Sara Haden, Ph.D., LIU



**Abstract:** Reflective functioning (RF) is the ability of a parent to understand and be more aware of their own internal mental state, thoughts and reasoning. It is unclear if RF influences joint play between fathers and sons, so the purpose of the study was to examine if fathers with higher RF are more supportive in their play with their sons compared to fathers who have both a lower RF and a higher endorsement of traditional masculine ideology. Twenty English-speaking, predominately married Caucasian fathers of typically developing sons ages 3 to 9 were recruited for the study. Videos of 15-minute, joint-play sessions recorded at home were analyzed using the Parent Support of Child Playfulness Scale. Surveys were given using the Male Role Norms Inventory-Revised scale and the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. An analysis revealed a significant correlation between a father's higher RF and a lower view of traditional masculinity ideology, and vice versa. Results also indicated no significant correlation between the father’s RF and support provided to his son during joint play.

### **A Multifaceted, Interactive, Child Development Toolkit for Jewish Parents**

**Author:** Miriam Graham, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Mindy Garfinkel, OTD, OTR/L



**Abstract:** Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a child's development and, therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges parents to monitor developmental milestones. However, the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities, including the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, due to their insular culture. An innovative, andragogy-based method to educate young ultra-Orthodox Jewish mothers, who spend significant time caring for their children, about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial. The purpose of this project is to create a children’s book, which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones. This dual-narration style is an effective way to educate parents, since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their co-occupation of spending time with their children.

**Author:** Molly Hampton, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisor:** Troy Dargin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP



**Abstract:** Over the last decade, technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world. This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old. The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parent/caretaker behavior have on children's language skills and behavior, as well as the impact of increased technology use on children’s development in these areas. The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness. This, in turn, could negatively impact the child's social language skills. More in-depth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on children’s developmental skills.

### **Modeling Complex Hand Grasps Using Muscle Activity of Movement Primitives**

**Faculty Advisor:** Sai Praveen Kadiyala, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Motor function of the hands is often lost as the result of a stroke and is difficult to restore, which has a detrimental effect on stroke survivors' ability to perform everyday tasks. Many methods exist to assist survivors in rehabilitation, but those based on surface electromyography (sEMG) hold promise due to their flexibility of placement, ease of data collection and patient comfort, and cost-effectiveness and increased patient motivation. A myoelectric exoskeleton controlled by sEMG sensors on the muscles of a patient's arm can be used in upper-limb rehabilitation therapy. In this work, we aim to model complex grasps belonging to activities of daily living (ADL) using simple movement primitives of upper arm and validate on a low-cost test bed. We collected sEMG data of five movement primitives and tried to model 10 grasps which are a part of ADL. A multiple linear regression applied on grasp and movement primitive data showed that some of the primitives had more of an impact on the model than others and that the gestures had an inconsistent effect on the model across multiple trials. Replication of both movement primitives and complex grasps on our test bed was conducted successfully.

**Faculty Advisor:** Robert Friedman, MBA

**Abstract:** MedImageMetric LCC (MIM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) post-processing software startup whose mission is to advance medical imaging via developing physics-informed automated quantitation tools that completely utilize clinically important image data for patient care. The MRI post-processing market is rapidly growing and evolving due to the emergence of new clinical applications for MRI and a better understanding of its benefits, thus presenting both a broad and deep opportunity for MIM through high demand from a large customer base. MIM’s innovative products, strong IP portfolio, experienced management team, strategic partnerships and regulatory clearances position the company for success in the growing medical imaging market. The goal of this project was to determine the appropriate sales strategy for MIM as they begin commercialization and marketing. The research, financial model and projections suggest that MIM has the potential to achieve sustainable growth, profitability and positive social impact if it pursues the original equipment manufacturer channel and subsequently the DTC (B) channel. With the right resources, support and execution, MIM can become a leading provider of MRI post-processing software, improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery worldwide.

**Author:** Samuel W. Akingbade, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Marian Gidea, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** A Hamiltonian system is a mathematical model for mechanical systems obeying the law of conservation of energy. When a perturbation is added to the system, the energy is not necessarily conserved, for instance, it may evolve randomly or even decay. We are interested in systems for which, despite the perturbation, we can obtain energy growth. Specifically, we consider a pendulum-rotator system coupled with a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, and with an additional damping perturbation. For this system, we prove the existence of diffusing orbits where the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. This work extends the celebrated Arnold diffusion conjecture to the case of Hamiltonian systems with small dissipation.

A full paper based on this work has been accepted for publication in the _SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems_, publication pending.

### **Addressing Emotional Regulation Through Interoception for Clinicians and Parents**

**Author:** Arielle Nyenty, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Interoception, which describes the concept of feeling, grasping and understanding one’s internal bodily sensations, plays a vital role in defining emotional regulation (ER) in early childhood and throughout life. Current research considers interoception a foundational component of effective ER, which was a concern for parents at My Kids Therapy, an occupational therapy sensory gym for children. The purpose of this project was to provide an alternative, evidence-based method for occupational therapists at My Kids Therapy to assess and address ER in children ages 4 to 6 through measuring and developing their interoception. Outcomes included the development of an interoception accuracy (IA) screening tool for clinicians to use with their clients, resources for parents and caregivers to address IA and ER in their homes, and a body-emotion diagram visually demonstrating the effect of interoception on ER to be used by clinicians, parents and families.

### **Forgive but Don’t Forget: Lessons Learned from the Paycheck Protection Program**

**Author:** Avi Skidelsky, M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization

**Faculty Advisors:** Andrew Catlin and James Topor, M.S.



**Abstract:** The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure, many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules. The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1% interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years. At the time of writing, the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85% of applicants totaling over $100 billion. Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program, the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud, this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request, using sampling techniques and machine learning methods. Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process. Instead, the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness.

### **Navier-Stokes Numerical Simulation of Vortices in the Compressible Gas Flow**

**Author:** Ellie Austin, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Antonella Marini, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science. The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the Couette-Taylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the Navier-Stokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package. The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders. The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder, and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature. Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature. With increasing Reynolds number values, the vortex density increased, reaching a certain level, then sharply decreased. A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature.

### **Evidence-Based Resources to Support Independence in Children and Young Adults with Physical Disabilities** ​

**Author:** Erin McGuire, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Mentor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L

**Abstract:** Students with cerebral palsy (CP) and other neuromuscular disorders place higher demands on classroom staff than their typically developing peers. CP is a neuromuscular condition that may result in impaired movement that is associated with exaggerated reflexes, floppiness or spasticity of the limbs and trunk, unusual posture, involuntary movements and unsteady walking. These characteristics may make it difficult for students with CP to function independently throughout the school day, leading to high dependency on classroom staff. Many students at CP Association of Nassau County (CP Nassau), a school catering to individuals with physical disabilities, require mobility and adaptive equipment, sensory equipment and custom hand splints, and classroom staff need to be well-versed in using this complex equipment. Conducted in collaboration with the Occupational Therapy Department at CP Nassau, this project aimed to identify staff needs and develop resources to aid them in supporting their students throughout the school day. Fifteen evidence-based training videos were created using a video modeling approach that can be accessed easily throughout the school day via a scannable QR Code. This training offers an accessible model that occupational therapists can adapt to fill similar gaps in knowledge among teachers and other staff.

### **Play and Arts-Based Program for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder**

**Author:** Harlee Feldman, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers. Additionally, art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity, social-emotional, language and cognitive skills. Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) because it works with the strengths of this population, such as attention to detail, while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population, such as cognitive flexibility. The project included the development of a play- and arts-based program, with the goal of increasing the self-esteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD. Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high self-esteem and good social skills.

### **Identifying the Gap: Clients Denied/Delayed Early Intervention Speech and Language Services Due to New CDC Milestones**

**Author:** Jillian Rossi, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisors:** Marissa Barrera, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Michaela Medved, Ph.D., CCC-SLP; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L



**Abstract:** In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control changed the developmental milestones for children from birth to 3 years old; it was the first change in over two decades. The modification included delaying selected speech and language milestones by six months. This decision yields a range of ramifications for young children and their families. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of children whose qualification for early intervention (EI) speech and language services will be delayed or denied as a result of the new guidelines; and the length of time children would be delayed receiving EI speech and language services in order to identify contributing risk factors for communication disorders and overall development. The study involved a survey of 63 speech-language pathologists who were asked to consider EI clients who just missed or met their milestones. The survey revealed that 49% of clients qualified for services later than they would have with the older developmental milestones. This study concluded that the new developmental milestones resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for clients.

### **Paternal Reflective Functioning and Its Impact on Joint Play**

**Author:** Julie Gurgova, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisors:** Amber Cope, Ph.D. candidate, LIU; Amiya Waldman-Levi, Ph.D., OTR/L, Katz School; Sara Haden, Ph.D., LIU



**Abstract:** Reflective functioning (RF) is the ability of a parent to understand and be more aware of their own internal mental state, thoughts and reasoning. It is unclear if RF influences joint play between fathers and sons, so the purpose of the study was to examine if fathers with higher RF are more supportive in their play with their sons compared to fathers who have both a lower RF and a higher endorsement of traditional masculine ideology. Twenty English-speaking, predominately married Caucasian fathers of typically developing sons ages 3 to 9 were recruited for the study. Videos of 15-minute, joint-play sessions recorded at home were analyzed using the Parent Support of Child Playfulness Scale. Surveys were given using the Male Role Norms Inventory-Revised scale and the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire. An analysis revealed a significant correlation between a father's higher RF and a lower view of traditional masculinity ideology, and vice versa. Results also indicated no significant correlation between the father’s RF and support provided to his son during joint play.

### **A Multifaceted, Interactive, Child Development Toolkit for Jewish Parents**

**Author:** Miriam Graham, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Mindy Garfinkel, OTD, OTR/L



**Abstract:** Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a child's development and, therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges parents to monitor developmental milestones. However, the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities, including the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, due to their insular culture. An innovative, andragogy-based method to educate young ultra-Orthodox Jewish mothers, who spend significant time caring for their children, about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial. The purpose of this project is to create a children’s book, which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones. This dual-narration style is an effective way to educate parents, since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their co-occupation of spending time with their children.

### **Does Increased Technology Use by Parents and Caregivers Impact the Social Language Skills of Developing Children?**

**Author:** Molly Hampton, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisor:** Troy Dargin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP



**Abstract:** Over the last decade, technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world. This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old. The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parent/caretaker behavior have on children's language skills and behavior, as well as the impact of increased technology use on children’s development in these areas. The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness. This, in turn, could negatively impact the child's social language skills. More in-depth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on children’s developmental skills.

> ""There are a bunch of guidelines on how much screen time children should use. However, I’m hoping this research gives parents a guideline for their own technology use—because parents’ screen time really does affect their children.

### **Modeling Complex Hand Grasps Using Muscle Activity of Movement Primitives**

**Author:** Natania Birnbaum, M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship

**Faculty Advisor:** Sai Praveen Kadiyala, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Motor function of the hands is often lost as the result of a stroke and is difficult to restore, which has a detrimental effect on stroke survivors' ability to perform everyday tasks. Many methods exist to assist survivors in rehabilitation, but those based on surface electromyography (sEMG) hold promise due to their flexibility of placement, ease of data collection and patient comfort, and cost-effectiveness and increased patient motivation. A myoelectric exoskeleton controlled by sEMG sensors on the muscles of a patient's arm can be used in upper-limb rehabilitation therapy. In this work, we aim to model complex grasps belonging to activities of daily living (ADL) using simple movement primitives of upper arm and validate on a low-cost test bed. We collected sEMG data of five movement primitives and tried to model 10 grasps which are a part of ADL. A multiple linear regression applied on grasp and movement primitive data showed that some of the primitives had more of an impact on the model than others and that the gestures had an inconsistent effect on the model across multiple trials. Replication of both movement primitives and complex grasps on our test bed was conducted successfully.

### **Brief Expository on Arnold Diffusion in Dissipative Systems**

**Author:** Samuel W. Akingbade, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisor:** Marian Gidea, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** A Hamiltonian system is a mathematical model for mechanical systems obeying the law of conservation of energy. When a perturbation is added to the system, the energy is not necessarily conserved, for instance, it may evolve randomly or even decay. We are interested in systems for which, despite the perturbation, we can obtain energy growth. Specifically, we consider a pendulum-rotator system coupled with a small, time-periodic Hamiltonian perturbation, and with an additional damping perturbation. For this system, we prove the existence of diffusing orbits where the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter. This work extends the celebrated Arnold diffusion conjecture to the case of Hamiltonian systems with small dissipation.

A full paper based on this work has been accepted for publication in the _SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems_, publication pending.

### **Characterization of Targets Regulated by SUMOylation in Mouse Spermatocytes**

**Authors:** Sayanto Pal and Shaye Weinstein, M.S. in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship; Margarita Vigodner, Ph.D., Stern College for Women, Yeshiva University



**Abstract:** In a considerable majority of male infertility cases, the underlying component has not been discovered. SUMOylation (post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers or SUMO proteins) has emerged as a crucial regulating event in several developmental processes, including reproduction. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SUMOylation arrests meiosis and affects expression and phosphorylation of several proteins. In order to confirm some of the identified targets and better comprehend the mechanisms regulated by SUMO in germ cells, SUMOylation cycle was down-regulated using inhibitors like Ginkgolic acid (GA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. The effect of the inhibition on the expression level and phosphorylation status of several proteins regulating meiosis and spermatogenesis, like Nucleophosmin (NPM), heterogenous ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) and Valosine containing protein (VCP), were studied using gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Results confirmed the down-regulation of these proteins upon inhibition of SUMOylation, suggesting the importance of their regulation during spermatogenesis. This finding underscores the significance of characterizing new proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate spermatogenesis.

### **Investigating Brain Injury in Domestic Violence Survivors and Individuals with Substance Misuse**

**Author:** Sheila Vousoghian, Occupational Therapy Doctorate

**Faculty Advisor:** Alexandra Wagner, Ph.D., OTR/L

**Abstract:** While there is ample research on the physical and psychological impacts of traumatic brain injuries and on the benefits of early identification and intervention in preventing lifelong complications from them, there is a lack of awareness of traumatic brain injury among domestic violence survivors and individuals with substance misuse. As a result, individuals who face domestic violence and substance misuse may not know they have or are not diagnosed with TBI, leading to diminished health outcomes. With the goal of increasing awareness, this project involved creating a full set of course materials that will be used as part of an online certification course to train domestic violence organizations on screening for traumatic brain injury; and creating and distributing a fact sheet on substance misuse and traumatic brain injury with the goal of early intervention. These interventions will increase awareness as substance misuse and domestic violence facilities become more familiar with the signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury.

### **Comparing Performance of Bilingual (English-Spanish) and Monolingual Students in Math and Science Assessments**

**Author:** Sophia Klass, M.S. in Speech-Language Pathology

**Faculty Advisor:** Troy Dargin, Ph.D., CCC-SLP



**Abstract:** This literature review compares the performance of school-age bilingual (English-Spanish) speakers to their monolingual peers in science and math classes. These courses were chosen due to the specific semantics (vocabulary) required to comprehend scientific and mathematical theories. This specialized vocabulary eliminates the possibility of monolingual students using their prior English-based lexicon as an advantage. The review involved analyzing numerous studies that evaluated how school-age bilingual (English-Spanish) students performed on assessments in comparison to their monolingual peers. Due to their complex level of cognitive functioning, the reviewed studies show that English-Spanish bilingual students performed the same and, in some cases, better on classroom assessments in science compared with their monolingual peers. Further research is needed to evaluate bilingual students’ performance in math. Educators, speech-language pathologists and inter-professional collaborators who work with bilingual children may be able to leverage bilingual students’ cognitive strengths when developing educational and therapeutic interventions, as well as visual supports and prompts, for this population.

**Author:** Xingyu Liu, Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences

**Faculty Advisors:** Wenxiong Chen, Ph.D. and Peter Nandori, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** This study explored the use of the Constructing Triangle Method (CTM) to solve trigonometric differential equations. CTM is a geometric method that involves constructing a triangle to represent the given trigonometric function and its derivatives. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of CTM by solving the trigonometric differential equation du/dt = cosu(t). We compared the solutions obtained by CTM with those obtained by other methods, such as separation of variables, substitution and integrating factors. Our results showed that CTM is a powerful method for solving trigonometric differential equations. It provides a clear geometric interpretation of the solution, which is easy to understand and visualize. Furthermore, it reduces the complexity of the problem by transforming it into a simpler geometric problem.

**Abstract:** The fieldwork experience is a crucial part of an occupational therapy student’s education. However, there is a lack of occupational therapists willing to take on supervisory roles as fieldwork educators due to limited available training. Through a comprehensive literature review across many health-related disciplines, this project aimed to identify key characteristics of successful fieldwork educators and develop a corresponding educator resource for occupational therapists interested in becoming supervisors. This fieldwork educator resource, which contains informative videos, slide presentations and quizzes, will be offered free to occupational therapists interested in taking on these supervisory roles on the Virginia Occupational Therapy Educational Council’s website.

### **Numerical Explorations in the Non-Linear Schrodinger Equation**

**Authors:** Yonah Moise and Yedidya Moise, B.A./M.A. in Mathematics

**Faculty Advisor:** Jeremy Schiff, Ph.D., Bar-Ilan University



**Abstract:** The Nonlinear Schrodinger equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose principal application is to the propagation of a beam of light. Saturated nonlinearity acts as a limitation on the nonlinear component of the equation to prevent it from blowing up. After reproducing initial conditions from Gatz and Herrmann (1997), which are based on certain constraints, the split-step method was applied to step forward in time and approximate the solution to this PDE for any given time. We then constructed a Gaussian function of two dimensions (with a power equivalent to the power of the solution) and ran the split-step method on this function to study it as an approximation of the solution. The observed two internal modes in the behavior of the widths, as well as other observed behavior, provide a basis for analysis of this approximate solution.

### **Magnetic Permeability Measurements in MRI**

**Author:** Yonathan Magendzo, B.A./M.A. in Physics

**Faculty Advisor:** Fredy Zypman, Ph.D.



**Abstract:** Detection of traces of iron in the brain is useful for medical applications. Different tissues possessing different magnetic permeabilities expose themselves via small spatial variations of the magnetic field during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Data acquisition and image analysis methods that visualize spatial distributions of magnetic permeabilities are known as quantitative permeability mapping. The permeabilities are found through local distortions in all components of the magnetic field. However, most modern techniques of MRI model the brain as a collection of magnetic dipoles and, therefore, only the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is assessable to MRI. An MRI machine doesn't have enough information to map the permeabilities. To address this problem, we developed an algorithm that can map the permeabilities only needing the longitudinal component of the magnetic field."

### Neer Asherie, Ph.D.

Neer Asherie's Bio



### Neer Asherie, Ph.D.

Dr. Asherie is a professor of physics and biology. His research interest is to make it possible to predict the phase behavior of protein solutions and to learn to control protein self-assembly. Proteins can self-assemble into a variety of phases (crystals, dense liquids, aggregates, and gels), but this phase behavior is not well understood. The inability to predict protein phase behavior inhibits progress on many biophysical problems, including protein condensation diseases, the industrial purification of proteins, and the determination of the high-resolution x-ray structures of proteins. A combined experimental and computation approach is used to understand the relationship between the molecular interactions and the macroscopic phases.

### Ran Drori, Ph.D.

**EXPERTISE:** Crystallization of water

Dr. Ran Drori, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Yeshiva University since 2017, teaches Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Stern College for Women. He is a co-founder of µ-Ice, a company that makes microscope-mounted cold-stages.

His current research focuses on the crystallization of water which affects various processes globally and in our daily lives. Ice crystals cause freezing when they grow inside organisms living in sub-freezing conditions. Similarly, the formation of gas hydrates in flowlines transporting gas and oil causes safety and economic risks, and the release of methane from gas hydrates to the atmosphere contributes to global warming. Antifreeze proteins are evolution’s answer to the problem of freezing in organisms, and some synthetic inhibitors of gas hydrates are currently in use. However, the mechanisms by which these natural and synthetic inhibitors work remain largely unclear.

His lab is using a unique combination of cold stages, fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics to study the effects of molecular agents on the crystallization of water.

Dr. Drori holds a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He was trained as a postdoctoral researcher at NYU's chemistry department.

**Abstract:** This project aimed to identify the most secure and efficient approach to user authentication for social networking sites. As technology use increases rapidly across the globe, the number of active social media users has reached 3.7 billion within just the last three years. This increasing demand urges social networking companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of their users. Several companies have introduced two-step verification mechanisms like verification codes and graphical passwords, but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques like sim hijacking. To create a more secure environment, this paper proposes a two-factor facial-recognition authentication engine using a dHash algorithm.

**Abstract:** This project aimed to apply deep learning methods to classify audio data. Traditionally, audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms. However, in the past few years, a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process more effective. This project applied deep learning methods to speech emotion recognition (the ability to discern a person’s emotions solely from their tone of voice). To do this, we gathered a base dataset of approximately 1400 audio clips, labeled as angry or not angry; augmented the dataset using a generative model; and then used transfer learning with a pre-trained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not. Ultimately, our predictions achieved accuracy greater than 90 percent. This work demonstrates that deep learning approaches work well with audio data, and even with limited data, as it is possible to augment datasets.

**Abstract:** This project, conducted on behalf of early-stage biotechnology company GritBio, explored the market potential and commercialization feasibility for LIGRECA, GritBio’s proposed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) treatment for hypopharyngeal cancer. This paper presents a market analysis, commercialization strategy and financial implications for the successful development and commercialization of GritBio’s new treatment. Specific recommendations include that GritBio apply for fast-track FDA approval, partner with a CDMO for manufacturing, prioritize sales and marketing and consider mergers and acquisitions with larger companies to expedite R&D, bypass competition and reduce cost.

**Abstract:** In this project, we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force vs. indentation curves produced by deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope. Currently, there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells. These methods, however, are slow and require testing outside of the body. Our theory depends on parameters such as Young’s Modulus, object length and Poisson’s ratio, which are obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force vs. indentation curves. Our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters in general and, in particular, in soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and their properties are often dependent on external stresses.

**Abstract:** This project, conducted on behalf of therapeutics startup GritBio, aimed to understand the market landscape for a novel topical treatment of Actinic keratosis (AK). Incidence of AK remains underestimated, and AK management may soon become a public health issue due to aging populations and the risks of transformation to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). While there are numerous treatment options for AK, no data have been published regarding the overall effectiveness of these therapies. Immunocompromised AK and SCC sufferers, particularly those with transplants, might find even more restricted treatment options in a crowded therapeutic field, as current treatments fail to address their increased vulnerability to toxic side effects. GritBio proposes a combination of two drugs—miltefosine and carmofur—in a novel composition for topical administration for the treatment of AK, which would provide the requisite cytotoxicity without the attendant adverse effects on immune cells. This project provides background on AK classification, existing treatment options and the potential market for GritBio’s new treatment option. Findings suggest a large potential market for GritBio’s proposed treatment, particularly among transplant and immunosuppressed patients.

**Abstract:** This study aimed to show that KAP1 regulates SUMOylation in testicular Sertoli cells. The molecular regulation of Sertoli cells and their crosstalk with germ cells has not been fully characterized. Small-ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins are essential for normal sperm development and are expressed in mouse and human Sertoli cells. However, the cell-specific role of SUMOylation in those cells has only started to be elucidated. In other cell types, including granulosa cells, SUMOylation is regulated by a SUMO ligase KAP1/Trim28. Deletion of KAP1 in Sertoli cells causes testicular degeneration. However, the role of KAP1 in those cells has not been identified. The results of this study show that both murine and human Sertoli cells undergo apoptosis upon inhibition of SUMOylation with a chemical inhibitor or via a siRNA technology, coupled with changes in the Sertoli cell proteome. Findings suggest that, among others, the expression of ER/stress-related proteins is highly affected by this inhibition. SUMOylation may also regulate the NOTCH signaling , which is important for the maintenance of the developing germ cells. Furthermore, siRNA-down-regulation of KAP1 in a Sertoli-derived cell line causes an almost complete inactivation of SUMOylation. In conclusion, SUMOylation regulates important survival and signaling pathways in Sertoli cells, and KAP1 can be a major regulator of SUMOylation in these cells.

**Abstract:** This study explored the application of Capture the Flag (CTF) events as an instructional approach in cybersecurity and information security (IS) curricula. In a classroom environment, technical skills can sometimes be overshadowed by theoretical knowledge. CTF events remove those barriers by allowing cybersecurity and IS students to use any tools in their arsenal to complete challenges related to the subject matter. CTF challenges range in difficulty and give students a snapshot of problems they may face in the real world. While CTF events are commonly used in the professional arena, they are often overlooked in academic settings because they are considered too gamified. In this project, we hypothesized that incorporating CTF events into the core IS and cybersecurity curriculum could promote students' learning and ultimately increase their chance of employment. The findings of this preliminary study support the use of CTF events as an instructional approach to support cybersecurity and IS students’ learning. Further research is warranted.

**Abstract:** This collaborative project between Yeshiva University’s Katz School of Science and Health and S&P Global Market Intelligence sought to quantify the financial effects of tropical cyclones on the U.S. real estate market. Using hurricane data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and proprietary real estate trust data from S&P databases, we analyzed the growing impact of tropical cyclones in the United States as well as the relationships between climate change and Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) financial losses. The analysis shows a relationship between the increasing frequency of hurricanes and the financial impact on RIETs, suggesting that REIT owning companies should invest in property risk mitigation expenditures before significant damage is done to their assets by tropical cyclones.

**Abstract:** This paper provides a review of scholarly sources aiming to identify the possible effects of dual language exposure for individuals with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). CAPD is a cognitively and auditorily demanding deficit affecting a person's ability to internally process sounds. It becomes increasingly difficult for an individual with CAPD to isolate, process, and/or comprehend sounds in overwhelming listening situations. Dual language exposure is also cognitively and auditorily demanding; however, research has shown it to be advantageous, stimulating auditory processing and increasing processing effectiveness in demanding listening situations. Based on a review of literature, it was found that for individuals with CAPD, dual language exposure may be more of a hindrance than a benefit, potentially leading to confusion in either language. In addition to specifying potential consequences and benefits, this paper provides implications for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) working with individuals concerned.

**Abstract:** The purpose of this literature review was to explore studies discussing the effects of societal changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on children’s expressive language development. Relevant studies addressed the effects of mask wearing on communication; the effects of providing speech-language pathology services remotely via tele-practice; and revised CDC milestones for children’s speech, language and literacy development. These societal changes have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of speech and language disorders. Further research is warranted to determine the extent of these effects as well as implications on children’s expressive language abilities after the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Professor Wins Awards for Quantum Systems

Read more about Dr. Lea Santos’ NSF research



#### Professor Wins Awards for Quantum Systems

Dr. Lea Ferreira dos Santos, professor of physics and chair of the physics department at Stern College for Women, has received two major awards that will significantly help her advance the computational study of many-body quantum systems.

In 2019, Dr. Santos received a $400,000 National Science Foundation grant to study “Nonequilibrium Quantum Matter: Timescales and Self-Averaging.” The grant is a collaboration between the NSF and the U.S.-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) that reduced barriers to working internationally. Using a lead agency model, U.S. and Israeli researchers can submit a single collaborative proposal that will undergo a single review process at NSF, which will be the lead agency.

“This collaboration,” noted Dr. Santos, “will allow for the combination of complementary skills and will significantly expand the NSF-PI’s group size and computer resources.” A further benefit of the collaboration will be that “the undergraduate students of Yeshiva University will have the opportunity to experience research at a Ph.D.-granting institution in Israel.”

This award supports computational and theoretical studies of the evolution of systems that have many interacting particles and which are described by quantum mechanics. These so-called many-body quantum systems are so complex that it is often impossible to describe their evolution analytically, which forces us to resort to numerical methods. But even numerically, the problem is challenging. Because the number of states that need to be considered grows exponentially with system size, existing computers soon run out of memory. As a result, despite being ubiquitous, these systems are still little understood. Understanding the properties of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium is a fundamental problem of great interest to a wide range of fields, from atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics to quantum information and cosmology. These studies may also lead to practical applications.

Dr. Santos also received notice that she had been selected as a Simons Fellows in Theoretical Physics by the Simons Foundation, an organization dedicated to “advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences.” The selection includes a $100,000 grant to support “sabbatical research leaves from classroom teaching and administrative obligations” and is based on “the applicant’s scientific accomplishments in the five-year period preceding the application and on the potential scientific impact of the work to be done during the leave period.”

Dr. Santos’ project will be “Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics of Many-Body Systems,” and as she explained it, the grant will give her the time and space to expand her current program of studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics by allowing her to “initiate a new research line, develop computer codes, strengthen current collaborations and establish new ones, and write proposals.”

Of course, Dr. Santos is thrilled by these awards, not only for the way they help her advance her career but also for the positive notice they bring to Yeshiva University. “I’m especially pleased,” she noted, “that the NSF grant will help my undergraduate students at Stern College work with leaders in the field and across the two countries. The Simons fellowship is a very prestigious award, and I’m humbled by being included in the exceptional company of the past awardees.”

Both Dr. Selma Botman, provost and vice president for academic affairs, and Dr. Karen Bacon, the Mordecai D. Katz and Dr. Monique C. Katz Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty of Arts and Sciences, were both thrilled to hear the news. “We are so very, very proud of her achievements,” said Dr. Bacon, “as well as of this recognition of her as an exceptional scientist and scholar.”

The mission of the YU Occupational Therapy Doctorate program is to educate and train students to become scholar-practitioners who are caring and competent in developing and delivering inclusive, equitable, evidence-driven services through the integration of theory, research and practice-based knowledge, as well as clinical skills.

Our student-centric pedagogy, programmatic themes and curricular threads (i.e., critical thinking, analysis and synthesis, clinical reasoning, self- and professional identity, civic and cultural awareness) will prepare students to be reflective and effective scholar-practitioners. These scholar-practitioners will be lifelong learners and advocates and leaders for the profession, as well as for diverse local and global communities. In state-of-the-art laboratories, alongside faculty, our students apply didactic content and build skills on how to promote health, well-being and resilience through occupational engagement.

## 

The philosophy of the Katz School’s Occupational Therapy Doctorate program, which is located in New York City, is reflective and responsive to the mission statement and values of Yeshiva University, the values of the occupational therapy profession and the professional values of the faculty of the Occupational Therapy Doctoral program. The program incorporates beliefs about health and well-being, as well as occupation and community, and its faculty, students and community work together to incorporate science, health and technology in their practice to realize a better future for patients and for society.

## 

Yeshiva University's Occupational Therapy Doctorate program has been granted full accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) at 7501 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 510E Bethesda, MD 20814.

The program's graduates are eligible to sit for the national certification examination to qualify as an occupational therapist by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). An individual will be considered an occupational therapist, registered (OTR), following successful completion of the exam. Though most states require licensure in order to practice, the state licenses are usually contingent on successful passage of the NBCOT certification examination. A felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination, as well as eligibility to obtain state licensure. For further questions, one may reach ACOTE online at  or AOTA at 301-652-6611. The National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) can be reached at .

## 

Upon successful completion of the Occupational Therapy Doctorate program, students will be able to:

- Develop and implement client-centered care that is inclusive of cultural values, beliefs and needs.
- Demonstrate effective communication skills to function successfully as a member of an interprofessional health care team.
- Apply critical analysis of evidence during the occupational therapy process and participate to increase the body of knowledge of the profession through the preparation and dissemination of scholarship.
- Design interventions with a central focus on occupation as the means and end of the therapeutic process that are in line with the profession’s philosophy.
- Implement interventions with a central focus on occupation as the means and end of the therapeutic process that are in line with the profession’s philosophy.
- Integrate health promotion and wellness in interventions with individuals, communities and populations.
- Model and demonstrate leadership and advocacy for occupational therapy in the full range of service areas.

## 

Graduates from the Occupational Therapy Doctorate program are eligible to sit for the national certification examination administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT) to qualify as an occupational therapist. After successful completion of this examination, the individual will be an occupational therapist, registered (OTR). Most states require licensure to practice, and state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT certification examination. Please note that a felony conviction or previous criminal record could affect eligibility to sit for the NBCOT examination, for a state license and, as a result, eligibility to practice. As part of your application to take the exam, you will be asked to answer questions related to the topic of felonies and or convictions. Please contact NBCOT for additional information prior to starting your Occupational Therapy Doctorate studies.

## About, Accreditation and Outcomes

## 

At its **March 2024** meeting, the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA) placed the **Yeshiva University Physician Assistant Program** sponsored by **Yeshiva University** on **Accreditation-Probation** status until its next review in **March 2026**.

Probation accreditation is a temporary accreditation status initially of not less than two years. However, that period may be extended by the ARC-PA for up to an additional two years if the ARC-PA finds that the program is making substantial progress toward meeting all applicable standards but requires additional time to come into full compliance. Probation accreditation status is granted at the sole discretion of the ARC-PA when a program holding an accreditation status of Accreditation - Provisional or Accreditation - Continued does not, in the judgment of the ARC-PA, meet the Standards or when the capability of the program to provide an acceptable educational experience for its students is threatened.

Once placed on probation, a program that fails to comply with accreditation requirements in a timely manner, as specified by the ARC-PA, may be scheduled for a focused site visit and is subject to having its accreditation withdrawn.

The Yeshiva University Physician Assistant Program is scheduled for a focused site visit in advance of the **March 2025** commission meeting. This visit will evaluate the PA Program and institutional progress in addressing specific citations identified during the course of the most recent commission review of the PA Program. Failure of the PA Program and institution to demonstrate significant progress in addressing these citations is likely to result in the withdrawal of accreditation.

Specific questions regarding the program and its plans should be directed to the program director and/or the appropriate institutional officials.

The program’s accreditation history can be viewed on the ARC-PA website at .

#### Program Mission

Yeshiva University’s PA program will prepare diverse, culturally competent physician assistants to lead lives of kindness, generosity and integrity as they provide excellent patient-centered health care for patients from all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. The PA program’s mission will be accomplished through the provision of a nurturing learning environment, excellence in teaching and learning, service to the community and the delivery of evidence-based medical education to people of all ages.

#### Program Goals

- **Clinical Excellence** – Graduates will demonstrate a knowledgeable, analytical approach to clinical situations and provide patient care that is effective, high quality and evidence-based to people of all ages.
- **Professionalism** – Graduates will provide health care ethically, compassionately and respectfully, as well as with integrity and accountability, and will demonstrate a commitment to excellence, lifelong learning and professional development.
- **Cultural Competence** – Graduates will effectively and sensitively provide culturally competent, equitable health care to an increasingly diverse patient population.
- **Leadership** – Graduates will contribute to and enrich the PA profession throughout their careers as mentors, educators, clinicians and members of state and national professional organizations. Graduates will contribute to the advancement of medicine and health care in their place of employment and in U.S. health care systems.
- **Scholarship** – Graduates will commit to lifelong learning, inquiry, study, evidence-based practice and continuous professional development.

#### Program Values

- **Kindness** – Care delivered with kindness, compassion and empathy facilitates healing and leads to better outcomes for patients and clinicians. Communication skills that foster the development of kindness and compassion will be honed through coursework and supervised patient-care experiences.
- **Generosity** – Recognition that the life of another is as valuable as one’s own is fundamental in the practice of medicine and the service of patients. Altruistic behavior and selflessness will be developed through active community service.
- **Integrity** – Integrity is the bedrock of trust development between the patient and clinician. Adherence to the highest standards of professionalism and ethics in the classroom and during supervised clinical practice experiences is mandatory.
- **Diversity** – Diversity of students and staff leads to a rich experience in the classroom and clinic, and fosters the development of cultural competence.

More than half of miscarriages are the result of chromosomal abnormalities in the fertilized egg, which can cause developmental problems that result in an unviable fetus. Russo-Schlossberg’s test would be important because individuals who miscarry in their first trimester typically do so at home and thus don’t have the opportunity to genetically test the fetal tissue to determine a cause.

#### Market Analysis Finds Commercial Promise for Cancer Drug

#### Market Analysis Finds Commercial Promise for Cancer Drug

Avi Strauss, a recent Katz School biotech graduate, has performed a detailed market analysis on a new drug therapy for colorectal cancer.

The analysis recommended that Sapience Therapeutics, a New York-based biotech company, develop a molecule called a novel beta-catenin antagonist for treatment of the cancer. Beta-catenin is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which promotes tumor growth and suppresses the immune system.

In addition to colorectal cancer, Strauss reviewed four other types of cancer that have high mortality rates and resist conventional therapies: acute lymphocytic leukemia, breast cancer, melanoma, and multiple myeloma.

He found that colorectal cancer patients would be a prime population for Sapience’s novel peptide because of the high incidence of a mutation in the Wnt signaling pathway that results in its overactivation and leads to the formation of cancer. “Colorectal cancer presents the highest upside according to the revenue projection model,” said Strauss, who is a healthcare consultant for the Marwood Group, “and presents the largest potential available population among the five cancer types studied.”

Sapience’s therapeutic approach, according to Dr. Kappel, is to target protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that seem necessary to the survival of cancer or that inhibit the immune system’s response to cancerous tumors. The interactions targeted by Sapience are considered “undruggable” due to the intracellular location of the PPIs, making them difficult to treat with small-molecule drugs such as chemotherapies that are incapable of disrupting PPIs, and biologic-based drugs like monoclonal antibodies that are too big to enter cells.

“Peptides combine the best properties of small and large molecules,” said Dr. Kappel, “and present an opportunity to disrupt intracellular PPIs and to reduce mortality in cancer patients and possibly in other diseases.”

Robert Friedman, an adjunct professor in the biotechnology program and Strauss’s advisor, said that Strauss’s presentation demonstrates the strength of the “molecule-to-market nature” of the Katz School’s biotechnology program and its emphasis on understanding the science, and translating it into practical and actionable decisions.

“Avi’s understanding of the science, clinical development and the market were all critical to successfully completing the project,” he said. “The _piece de resistance_ of his elegant work is undoubtedly the market forecast model that the client will incorporate in its corporate planning process for years to come.”

#### Deep Learning Model Interventions with Applications

Ramesh Natarajan, Yeshiva College

Read more about AI foundation models



#### Deep Learning Model Interventions with Applications

This project concerns the use of large foundation AI models for new tasks by modifying them instead of creating new models from scratch. These foundation models take a lot of computing power to train, but they show good, “out-of-the-box” baseline performance in many tasks. The project aims to take these pre-trained models and improve and adjust them for new tasks, a process called “transfer learning."" The goal is to create tools that help apply this method to real-world problems, such as analyzing medical and remote-sensing images, by starting with large models trained on different types of data and improving them for specific tasks.

#### High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization

David Sweet, M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, aims to improve a method called Bayesian Optimization, which helps design and enhance systems like AI models, social media platforms and pharmaceuticals by running experiments. These experiments are essential for seeing how well a system works, but they can be expensive and time-consuming. His project will focus on dealing with complex systems that have many variables, or dimensions. More dimensions usually mean more experiments, but his goal is to reduce the number of experiments needed while still finding the best solutions. He and his eam are developing a new algorithm to make this process faster and more efficient, especially for systems with many variables.

#### Identification of Molecular Glues for Targeted Protein Degradation

Rajalakshmi Viswanathan, Yeshiva College

#### Identification of Molecular Glues for Targeted Protein Degradation

This project will investigate a new approach to treating diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory and immune disorders, by targeting proteins that are traditionally considered “undruggable.” These proteins are difficult to attack with regular drugs because they lack suitable sites for binding or can’t interact with the enzyme Ubiquitin ligase, which helps degrade and remove unwanted proteins in cells. To solve this problem, Viswanathan’s team is using a new technique involving small molecules called molecular glue degraders. These molecules help bring the problematic protein, called the protein of interest, and the enzyme Ubiquitin ligase, called the effector protein, close together. The project aims to find the best molecular glue from a library of small molecules that can form this ternary complex and effectively degrade the target protein.

#### Cascading Failures in the Banking Network

_Faculty Lead:_

- **Dr. Gabriel Cwilich**, Katz School M.A. and Ph.D. in Physics

The collapse of one financial institution can result in the failure of many others since banks possess assets in other banks, and the effects of the loss of value of one of them has consequences for the others. Dr. Cwilich and his team are trying to model this effect of cascading failures through the tools of network theory, which have been used successfully to model other cascading phenomena in electric energy distribution, communication networks and epidemics. For the first time, they are incorporating the real cross-holdings of the different banks in the design of the model of the network, as well as the further depreciation of assets that ensues after the public loses confidence in the solvency of the failing banks.

#### Cascading Failures in the Banking Network

_Faculty Lead:_

- **Dr. Gabriel Cwilich**, Katz School M.A. and Ph.D. in Physics

The collapse of one financial institution can result in the failure of many others since banks possess assets in other banks, and the effects of the loss of value of one of them has consequences for the others. Dr. Cwilich and his team are trying to model this effect of cascading failures through the tools of network theory, which have been used successfully to model other cascading phenomena in electric energy distribution, communication networks and epidemics. For the first time, they are incorporating the real cross-holdings of the different banks in the design of the model of the network, as well as the further depreciation of assets that ensues after the public loses confidence in the solvency of the failing banks.

#### Improving Commercial Success of Innovations Led by Women in STEM

_Faculty Lead:_

- **Lorraine Marchand**, industry professor, 

The number of women entrepreneurs in STEM lags far behind the number of men. Only 20% of Fortune 500 chief innovation officers are women, women founders represent 2-3% of venture capital investments, women make up 2-3% of venture capital partners, and there is a 16% gender wage gap among STEM professionals. Half as many women as men are likely to start their own business, and 95% of women who do start their own business fail within a year because they can’t secure funding and other necessary support.

In this project, Lorraine Marchand will work with women entrepreneurs in the early stages of their technology startups. She will implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach described in her book, _The Innovation Mindset: Eight Essential Steps for Transforming Any Industry,_ as well as her _Resource Guide for Women Innovators_, to increase the chances of commercial success for women innovators in STEM. The work is intended to raise the profile and number of women entrepreneurs in STEM and to demonstrate that women innovators can raise funds and experience commercial success by following a structured process and with appropriate coaching and support.

# Complex Systems Lab

## Making the World Smarter, Safer and Healthier









## **Welcome**

Many real-life systems encountered in the sciences (physics, biology, climate, social sciences, economics and finance) are complex systems, in which a large number of components are subject to intricate interactions that change over time. The interactions are frequently driven by concurrent deterministic and stochastic processes. Sometimes, the systems can be modeled starting from fundamental principles that govern them. Other times, information about the systems comes from empirical observations in the form of large data sets. One challenging problem is to understand the behavior in time of such systems and forecast their future evolution.

Current projects cover several areas, including:

- Dynamical systems and applications to celestial mechanics and astrodynamics;
- Topological data analysis;
- Financial bubbles detection;
- Credit risk.

## **Current Projects**



## Stability and Instability in Hamiltonian Systems

Hamiltonian systems represent mathematical models of mechanical systems that conserve total energy. In Hamiltonian dynamics, stability and instability often coexist. For some applications one is interested to ensure the stability of the system, while in others one is interested to exploit the instability. We are also studying the effect of small dissipation on Hamiltonian systems. Applications range from celestial mechanics and space mission design to optimizing the performance of piezo-electric energy harvesting devices.





## Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a new method to analyze complex, multi-dimensional data via topological tools. TDA aims to identifies patterns and features in data not apparent through traditional statistical methods. While statistical methods rely on describing data via distribution functions, TDA is describing data in terms of the \`shape’ of a point cloud. Changes of shape reflect subtle shifts in the patterns of the underlying data. We are interested in developing applications of TDA to biomedical sciences, climate, networks, and engineering.



## Financial Bubbles Detection

We are interested in detection of market crashes and financial bubbles. In particular, we are interested in identifying early warning signals for such extreme events, which have practical applications, such as minimizing the losses from a bubble crash, or maximizing the profit from a rapid rebound. In some earlier works, we developed a TDA-based methodology for the detection of financial bubbles.

#### Clinic Helping to Restore Voice of Man Who Championed Voiceless

In 2019, a brain injury ended Henry Hecker's career and deprived him of his ability to speak, but on a recent Zoom call, he was determined to get his voice back with the aid of two students in the Katz School’s .

In separate half-hour sessions, Alexa Bliss and Joanna Pace patiently and enthusiastically guided Henry through exercises to reclaim his memory, helped him articulate words and phrases, and encouraged him to advocate for himself, with Julia, his wife of 34 years, nearby.

#### The Care is Virtual, the Commitment is Real

Read about Dr. Michaela Medved’s approach to treating patients during the coronavirus pandemic



#### The Care is Virtual, the Commitment is Real

While Dr. Michaela Medved’s approach to treating patients has been severely affected by the coronavirus, her job at its heart hasn’t changed. She still works in her clinical practice with children and adults to continue focusing on their therapy goals. In recent weeks, however, that has meant communicating with them over video as opposed to treating them at home or in the hospital.

“I’ve been able to maintain a working relationship with my older clients in virtual sessions,” said Dr. Medved, a clinical assistant professor in the Speech-Language Pathology program at Yeshiva University’s Katz School of Science and Health. “But for clients who have feeding or swallowing disorders and underlying medical conditions, I haven’t been able to treat them because it’s dangerous for them. That’s been really tough.”

A good share of the burden of care, said Dr. Medved, has shifted temporarily to the families of patients. But she maintains regular contact, guiding caregivers on how to administer treatments to her patients. For the past six months, she has been working with a 10-year-old girl, a pediatric stroke victim, in her home until the virus prevented her from visiting. To make sure, though, that the girl’s care continued uninterrupted, she gave the parents responsibility, albeit under her watchful eye, for improving the girl’s feeding skills.

Using FaceTime, Dr. Medved showed the parents how to use a Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation device, which is half the size of a smart phone, to administer an intermittent electrical current to their child during a meal. The current, delivered by two electrodes under the girl’s chin for half an hour, four times a week, is meant to strengthen her tongue and swallowing muscles. Even with the loss of in-person contact, Dr. Medved, by checking in with the parents regularly, has ensured that the girl is making steady progress. She’s graduated from eating puree to normal breakfast foods, like waffles.

“We have remained in contact to discuss her progress as well as new foods and textures,” said Dr. Medved, “but I haven’t been charging anything because I don’t feel comfortable. I’m sensitive to the fact that these families have more than one child and are overburdened with home schooling.”

Dr. Medved said that though teletherapy is a “wonderful” alternative in many cases, she emphasized that it’s not a replacement for in-person care for every patient population. She has found that teletherapy is most successful when working with older school-age children, adolescents and adults with a variety of diagnoses, including expressive and receptive language delays, articulation disorders, cognitive dysfunction and fluency disorders.

“Though appropriate at times, teletherapy has been increasingly difficult to use with younger children—birth to three—older adults with compromised cognition, and patients with feeding and swallowing issues,” she said.

Dr. Medved said the current lockdown is teaching her how to be flexible. She said healthcare professionals are now beginning to work through online platforms regardless of where their settings once were, and though teletherapy will undoubtedly become increasingly popular and more readily used and accessible, in-person therapy will always remain the ideal modality for providing therapy services.

Since 2016, Dr. Medved has been with the Katz School and has taught courses in Clinical Speech-Language Pathology, Diagnostic Methods, Syndromes and Craniofacial Anomalies, Communicating with Patients and Families, and Stuttering and Related Fluency Disorders.

She holds a doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology from Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions, and a master’s degree in Speech-Language Pathology and bachelor’s degree in Speech Pathology and Audiology from Lehman College.

The Katz School’s master’s program in Speech-Language Pathology is one of the few in the country specializing in medical speech pathology, taking a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing and treating speech, language and communication cases. Students graduate prepared to apply for certification from the American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) and for licensure in New York State.

Dr. Medved recently published the article,  on the website of the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions.

She said she can foresee the important role that the medical speech-language pathologist will play in the rehabilitation of individuals globally. In order to serve those patients, she emphasized that it’s imperative that students be trained in the most up-to-date modalities for intervention, evidence-based practice and therapy options.

“Though we cannot foretell the extent of the needs that will be required, we can predict that as patients recover there will be a need for the restoration of swallowing, voice, motor speech disorders and respiratory de-conditioning,” she said.



#### Developing an Assessment for Diagnosing Autism in Bilingual Children

Read about May Mahmoud's experience with the SLP program



#### Developing an Assessment for Diagnosing Autism in Bilingual Children

Helena Goodman, a marketing manager at Yeshiva University, recently spoke with SLP student May Mahmoud about her experience at the Katz School of Science and Health.

May Mahmoud is in her last semester of the Katz School’s Speech-Language Pathology program. Originally from Alexandria, Egypt, she currently lives in Brooklyn. May is bilingual in Arabic and English, and holds an undergraduate degree in speech-language pathology from Brooklyn College. Helena Goodman, a marketing manager at Yeshiva University, recently spoke with May about her experience at the Katz School of Science and Health.

**Q: How have you adapted your SLP practice during COVID-19?**

I used to provide services to children and geriatrics in person, but I transitioned to teletherapy and distance-based therapy as COVID-19 hit. It has definitely been an adjustment for my clients, as a lot of them have never worked with a pathologist remotely before. Yet, we have been able to continue to provide help to our clients, as the need does not stop. Many things have been put on pause during COVID-19; however, an elderly person recovering from a stroke does not have the luxury to stop his therapy. We continue to provide the care that is needed to help our clients in their situations.

**Q: Have you found anything that has made the transition easier?**

I have found that sometimes you need to compensate for the fact that you are not doing face-to-face therapy. Certain methods are much harder via Zoom, such as play-based therapy.  Children with autism cannot sustain eye contact and their attention, but as we transitioned I have found ways to supplement this. I use the shared-screen option for book readings and pointing to things. This has resulted in many of my clients gaining new skills from remote therapy; I believe that even the geriatric population is now learning a bunch of new skills by using these platforms. I also see the confidence they are gaining by mastering these platforms.

**Q: What are some of the benefits of the Katz program?**

The Katz program stood out to me because it was the only one that provided a medical track and an SLP education with an emphasis on working in a medical setting, as well as an educational setting. Without a medical background, you cannot work in a hospital or nursing facility. Many don’t realize that our field helps more than children, but those across the lifespan and with varying abilities. The Katz courses are incredibly specialized and specific, providing you experience in a variety of topics. Marissa Barrera also was a deciding factor. We spent over an hour on the phone before I was accepted. She was humble and personable. It just clicked—the cherry on the top for why I chose Katz.

**Q: What did you focus your research on?**

My investigation focused on “Assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Bilingual Children.” Standardized assessments are often considered the gold standard for identifying diagnoses. This research examined the efficacy of standardized assessments in diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder in bilingual children. My long-term goal is to develop a standardized assessment for Arabic-speaking individuals.

**Q: Any advice for prospective students?**

You have to be passionate – that passion will give you the drive to work hard. It is not an easy program, but it will prepare you for the real world and work in the field. You have to be positive you want to be in the program: you are treating people who are in critical condition and you need the skills and patience to give them what they need. The ability to help them will come from that passion.



#### After Brain Injury, Bilingual Speakers’ Recovery of Language Varies

Read about Christopher Almonte's research on bilingual speakers' recoveries



#### After Brain Injury, Bilingual Speakers’ Recovery of Language Varies

Research by recent SLP graduate concluded that the recovery pattern of expressive and receptive language skills for bilingual speakers can vary after a traumatic brain injury.

“Recovery can occur in different ways depending on the site of the lesion, the severity of the impact, the age of the patient and the success of the treatment methods,” said Christopher Almonte, who graduated in May from the Katz School of Science and Health.

Receptive language skills have to do with the ability to understand words, sentences and the act of speaking, while expressive language skills are about producing speech.

Children with a receptive language disorder struggle to process speech while engaged in conversation and may rely too much on reading facial expressions. Those with an expressive language disorder may rely on simplified messaging strategies that prevent them from translating more complex thoughts into language.

The focus of Almonte’s analysis was on the likelihood of spontaneous language recovery for bilingual English-Spanish speakers compared to monolingual speakers, as well as which assessment techniques lead to an appropriate diagnosis of aphasia in bilingual speakers.

Almonte, who immigrated from the Dominican Republic at the age of fifteen, originally wanted to be a journalist but decided to become a speech-language pathologist after witnessing their work when he was a teacher assistant in the New York City Department of Education. He transferred from Bronx Community College, where he was working toward an associate’s degree, to Lehman College where he went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree in speech-language pathology.

“When I saw the work speech pathologists were doing with people with communication, language and feeding disorders, it was like my heart went right into it,” said Almonte. “I wanted to be that person who makes people’s lives better.”

During his time at the Katz School, he was a graduate clinical extern at Kingsbridge Center, Riverdale Senior Services and P.S. X811, all in the Bronx, where he facilitated pediatric language-enrichment sessions, provided geriatric patients with timely therapeutic services, and administered one-on-one and group treatment to students between the ages of 14 to 21 with a primary diagnosis of autism, emotional disturbance and language impairments.

At Ahava Medical in Brooklyn, the site of his last externship, he provided feeding and swallowing therapy to school-age children with Agenesis of corpus callosum—a rare birth defect—behavioral feeding difficulties and Down Syndrome.

After he graduated, he was hired as a speech-language pathologist by the Bronx-based Important Steps, an early childhood program that provides therapeutic and diagnostic services to children with developmental disabilities.

In the research analysis capping his Katz School career, Almonte cited a study conducted in 1997 by Michel Paradis that identified six different patterns of recovery for bilingual learners: parallel, selective, differential, antagonistic, successive, and blended (mix) recovery.

Parallel recovery takes place when both languages are impaired and recover simultaneously. Selective recovery occurs when both languages are capable of being recovered but only one actually does. Differential recovery happens when one language returns to normal. Antagonistic recovery takes place when one language starts to recover but then regresses once the second language begins recovering. Successive recovery occurs when a language starts to recover only after the other language is fully restored. And in a blended (mix) pattern, recovery follows no one pattern.

Almonte said there isn’t enough evidence on how to choose an appropriate assessment battery, however it’s important any assessment for bilingual individuals be sensitive to client experiences. He pointed to a study that found that a Spanish-speaking client who lived in Britain and had aphasia struggled to name a “hedge,” since they are unlikely to be found in Spain. The client’s inability to name the hedge decreased the client’s score in an aphasia battery.

Loretta Ching'andu

From Zambia to the UN

For as long as I can remember, I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something, where young girls can dream without limits, where voices from the margins are heard at the center, and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is.

But life has also taught me that belief alone isn’t enough. It takes action. It takes showing up, even when you’re unsure. It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there.

From my early advocacy years, I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change. I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa (CYLA), When Females Lead, and Girls Gone Political. These organizations pushed me, refined me, and prepared me for bigger moments to come. They taught me that no seat at the table is too big, no stage too grand, and no issue too complex for young people to lead on.



On February 5, 2025, I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters, leading a high-level session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5: Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum. As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY) Gender Youth Caucus, I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time.

The company was both humbling and inspiring. I was privileged to be joined by: H.E. Ambassador Al-Wasil – Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women; Shawyn Patterson-Howard – Mayor of Mount Vernon, New York; Aarushi Khanna – Asia-Pacific Regional Lead, Equal Measures 2030; Foteini Papagioti – Deputy Director of Policy & Advocacy, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW); Olela Tonny – Gender Expert, Child Protection & SRHR Advocate; and Diene Keita – Deputy Executive Director of Programme, UNFPA.

The conversation was urgent, necessary, and deeply personal. We discussed barriers women and girls still face, the financing gaps for gender equality, and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact. And how the world cannot afford to sideline women’s voices, expertise, and leadership any longer because when women lead, communities thrive, economies grow, and societies become more just.

In my years of advocacy, I’ve also learned that sometimes, proximity is everything. Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard.

A year ago, I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time, never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open. Today, I find myself leading conversations that shape the future.

But this is not just my story. It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream. It is the story of every young advocate, every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be. Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem. They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work, to the learning, to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens.

This is why I do what I do.

Dreaming Big in NYC

Hey there! I’m Yining from the beautiful Yunnan Province in China. I took the leap to study abroad because I was super curious about exploring different cultures and diving into new experiences.

Why Yeshiva University’s Katz School? It’s simple—this place has a stellar biotech program, a super diverse group of classmates, and it's in New York City! If you're even a bit interested, my advice? Just go for it!

My favorite class has got to be Biotechnology Management. It’s not every day you get to learn directly from folks who are rocking it in the biotech world. We’ve had a bunch of guest lecturers share the ins and outs of the industry, and it’s been nothing short of inspiring. I was also taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed Finance for Startups and Entrepreneurial Ventures. Finance isn’t really my jam, but this course opened my eyes to the nuts and bolts of financial planning—crucial info for anyone looking to commercialize new tech.



One of the coolest parts of my journey here has been joining professor Ran Drori’s biochemistry lab as a research assistant. We’re exploring antifreeze proteins and their potential to stop ice from forming at low temps—which holds potential for revolutionizing food preservation. This is the kind of hands-on experience that’s gearing me up for my dream—pursuing a PhD.

Living in NYC is as great as it sounds. Walking by the Empire State Building daily never gets old. The lights, the buzz—it’s magical. And yeah, the city’s expensive, but trust me, it’s totally manageable with a bit of savvy budgeting.

My advice for new students? Stay curious and find your passion. Dive into group projects, network through professional events, and get real experience in labs. These are your golden tickets to wherever you want to go next. So, to all the future students out there—dream big, get involved, and embrace your adventure here. You’ve got this!

**生物学生聚光灯：张怡宁**

**技术管理与创业硕士，2025届 - 耶史瓦大学科学与健康卡茨学院**

大家好！我是来自中国云南的张怡宁。从小我就对世界万物充满了好奇心，希望长大后有机会探索体验不同国家和城市的生活。高中毕业我选择了从云南到北京，在北京中医药大学度过了充满活力的四年。毕业后我依旧充满好奇心的选择了留学美国。如果问我为什么选择就读耶史瓦大学卡茨学院？理由很简单，因为这里的生物技术项目设计非常前沿，学生群体多样化，同时相比同等大学昂贵的学费，卡茨的性价比更高。并且，这是纽约市呀！一个非常多元化的大都市。

硕士期间，我最喜欢的课程是生物技术管理，这门课的亮点是教授邀请了很多来自生物技术领域的嘉宾，对于像我这样的职场小白，有更多近距离与专业人士的机会，通过课上的互动可以快速了解该领域的前沿发展与挑战，非常鼓舞人心，最重要的部分是可以拓宽未来职业规划的赛道选择。除此之外，在卡茨我第一次接触到创业风险财务管理相关课程，我一直认为自己对财务领域不感兴趣，但是通过该课程的学习，出乎意料的发现了自己的新兴趣领域。通过进一步学习，我也深刻意识到财务规划与管理的重要性，尤其是对于任何希望将新技术商品化的企业或个人。

在卡茨学院，最幸运的事情应该是加入了Ran Drori教授的生物化学实验室，成功的成为一名研究助理。目前，我们正在研究抗冻蛋白及其在低温下阻止冰形成的潜力，也许不久的将来可能会成为下一个创新的食品保存技术！通过这段实验室经历，也让我坚定了下一步攻读博士学位的决心。

在卡茨学院除了忙碌的学习之外，我非常喜欢纽约这个充满活力的城市。生活在纽约每天都会遇到各种新鲜的事物，比如放学途中路过帝国大厦，每天都是不同的灯光主题，永远看不腻。谈起纽约，我相信很多人都会担忧高昂的生活成本，所以不得不放弃。的确，这个城市生活成本真的很高，但是请相信我，只要精打细算完全可以有效控制你的生活成本。

最后我想对未来的学弟学妹们一点儿建议，希望你们能一直保持好奇心，不断尝试寻找自己喜欢且擅长的领域。同时建议大家积极参与学校以及纽约市的各类团队项目，不断拓展自己的人脉，为自己的未来添砖加瓦。相信自己。你们可以做到的！

Runway Dreams

**From Social Media Influencing to NY Fashion Week**

Hello everyone! I’m thrilled to introduce myself. I'm a digital marketing and media student who recently moved to the vibrant city of New York from Jharkhand, India. The energy here is palpable, and every corner seems to hold a new adventure. From the iconic skyline to the endless cultural experiences, I am constantly inspired by everything NYC has to offer.

My adventure in social media began seven years ago when I decided to share my passion with the world. Starting with just 1,000 followers, I posted about my love for lifestyle, travel, beauty, and fashion. I remember feeling a rush every time someone liked or commented on my posts.

It was a slow climb, but I was determined to grow my community. Through trial and error, I learned the ins and outs of social media all on my own. I spent countless hours researching trends, experimenting with different types of content, and engaging with my followers. I embraced my authenticity, sharing my unique story, and it paid off—I eventually grew my Instagram follower count (@missfashioncupid) to over 100,000!



Once I arrived in NYC, that growth had no limit. Just a highlight: I got the incredible opportunity to go to New York Fashion Week 2024 as a Creator Guest for Runway 7 and to walk as a model for the brand ELJ Avenue and the Indian brand KHOOB at NYFW.

Reflecting on my social media journey, I’ve learned some valuable lessons. Here are my top three secrets to becoming an influencer:

— **Authenticity is Key:** People crave real stories. When I started sharing my true self, my audience began to connect with me on a deeper level.

**—****Consistency Matters:** I learned that posting regularly is crucial. By staying engaged with my followers, I built trust and loyalty, turning casual viewers into a supportive community.

**—****Master the Tools:** Familiarizing myself with various platforms and analytical tools helped me understand what worked best for my audience, guiding my growth.

**The Power of Networking**

One of the most significant lessons I’ve learned is the power of networking. Every connection I’ve made has opened new doors—whether for collaborations, friendships, or mentorships. I've made it a priority to attend workshops, social gatherings, school and academic events and NYC happenings, like pop-ups, brand parties, launches, and store invitations. These events have enriched my experience and allowed me to meet inspiring individuals who motivate me to grow. These events have also deepened my understanding of the marketing culture in the U.S. and helped me network and connect with more people and brands.

Sometimes, it can be tiring to attend all these events, but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward. I realize this is something I can’t afford to tire of; it’s too important for my growth and journey!

For new students like me, the fast-paced NYC environment can be a bit overwhelming. Here are a few tricks to help you stay connected and involved:



**—****Follow Local Influencers:** They often share events and hidden gems that might otherwise slip under the radar. Their insights are invaluable!

**—****Use Event Apps:** Platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup are my go-to for finding local happenings and networking opportunities. I also recommend secret nyc and nycbucketlist.

**—****Join University Groups:** Follow school’s newsletter to stay updated with what's happening in and around the campus and the city. And keep an eye on the school's and clubs' social media pages, which often highlight events around campus and in the city, making it easier to get involved.

**Looking Ahead**

As my graduate studies in this vibrant city come to an end, I find myself dreaming about the future. I’m passionate about social media marketing and see it as a perfect blend of creativity and strategy. I envision myself working with brands that align with my values, helping them elevate their online presence.

The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies, analyze consumer behavior, and apply data-driven insights—all of which I've started integrating into my influencer work. These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goals—creating win-win partnerships.

As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC, I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me: the professors, the classmates, the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey. The path ahead is full of potential, and I’m excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing.

For those just starting their journey, remember to embrace your authenticity, keep learning, and harness the power of networking. Let’s make the most of this incredible city together, chasing dreams, and creating connections along the way. Here’s to new adventures!

Global Citizen

From the bustling streets of Harare, Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City, my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery. Growing up in Zimbabwe, a country rich in culture and resilience, I embarked on a career in banking, starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller. Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact. My story is also one of adaptation and growth, from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing, driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change.

Today, I am immersed in the world of digital marketing and media at Katz School of Science and Health. My inspiration to pursue my master's in digital media came from observing my former employer's transformation into a digital bank in Zimbabwe. Witnessing this evolution ignited my curiosity about how digital innovations can reshape industries globally.

Choosing the Katz School was a natural fit for me. Its diverse culture, which I discovered while browsing the school's website, and its prime location in the heart of New York City—a place I've always dreamed of living—made it feel surreal.

In addition to my studies, I serve as a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing, where I guide international students in choosing their programs and schools, helping them secure funding for their education. By combining my financial sector experience with my growing knowledge in digital marketing and media, I aim to offer invaluable support to students navigating their academic journeys.

My favorite class is Consumer Behavior. Coming from a finance background, I lacked knowledge about utilizing consumer behavior in developing marketing strategies. This class has been enlightening, and our professor, Sivia Naimer, is incredibly engaging, friendly, and caring, making the learning experience even more enjoyable.

My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to me—freedom, opportunity, and a rich, diverse history. Coming from Harare, I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings.

On the other hand, Central Park feels like home. It's my go-to place to escape the hustle and bustle, unwind, and enjoy some peace and tranquility. There's something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the city's energy in a way that's comforting and familiar.

My advice for incoming students is to embrace the rich tapestry of cultural diversity you'll encounter—it's one of the greatest assets you'll experience. Stay ahead academically by being proactive and disciplined in your studies, ensuring you build a solid foundation for your future. Managing your finances wisely is crucial; develop a budget and stick to it to avoid unnecessary stress. Surround yourself with a strong support network of friends, mentors, and advisors who will uplift and guide you. Prioritize your physical and mental health, as they are vital to your overall success and well-being. Take the time to explore and enjoy your new environment, as it will broaden your horizons and enrich your experience. Lastly, maintain a positive and resilient attitude, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and development. With these principles, you'll not only survive but thrive in this new chapter of your life.

Embarking on the journey to America is both exciting and challenging. As someone who has made this journey, I would like to share some tips to help you prepare and succeed:

**— Research and Plan Ahead:** Familiarize yourself with the visa process, university requirements, and the city you’ll be living in. Proper planning will help you avoid last-minute surprises.

**—** **Cultural Adaptation:** Embrace the cultural diversity and be open to learning. Engage with different cultures to enrich your experience and broaden your perspective.

**— Academic Preparedness:** Stay ahead in your studies by understanding the academic expectations and resources available. Make use of study groups, tutoring services, and office hours to excel in your coursework.

**— Financial Management:** Budget wisely. Understand the cost of living in your new city and manage your finances to avoid unnecessary stress. Look for part-time job opportunities that align with your visa regulations. As a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing, I can assist you with financial advice and resources tailored to international students.

**—** **Build a Support Network:** Connect with fellow students, join international student organizations, and participate in campus activities. Having a support network will make your transition smoother and your experience more enjoyable.

**— Stay Healthy:** Take care of your physical and mental health. Utilize university health services and maintain a balanced lifestyle to ensure you can perform your best academically and socially.

**— Explore and Enjoy:** Take time to explore your new environment and enjoy the unique experiences it offers. Visit local attractions, try new foods, and immerse yourself in the local culture.

**— Stay Positive and Resilient:** There will be challenges along the way but stay positive and resilient. Every experience, good or bad, is an opportunity to learn and grow. America is a land of opportunities, and with determination and preparation, you can achieve your dreams. Good luck on your journey!

Discovering the Magic of Central Park

I used to live in Siberia, where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bone-chilling 36 degrees below zero. Amid those harsh conditions, I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park, which I kept as my desktop screensaver. This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold, and it kindled a dream within me. I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree. Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize.

Last year, I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health, which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality. Central Park, once a distant daydream, now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams.

Every Sunday, I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty, enjoy a picnic, and soak up the atmosphere. Central Park, to me, has become more than just a scenic escape; it's a testament to the power of belief. It proves that dreams, no matter how big or seemingly impossible, can come true for those who refuse to give up.

**Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park:**

**\-**  **:** It's a wide-open field with a view of skyscrapers, perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends.

 **:** This historic structure is one of the first built in the park. I love walking here, admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians. Fun fact: you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2.

\-  **:** I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City. This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia, and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my once-impossible dream had come true.

**\-**  **:** One of the most iconic features of Central Park, this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake.

**\-**  **:** Also known as Central Park Reservoir, it covers a significant portion of the park's surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline.

Central Park isn't just a fair-weather friend. It boasts year-round attractions: cherry blossoms in the spring (between 72nd and 96th streets), ice-skating rinks in winter and biking in the summer.

To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and, indeed, New York City, there's no better way than strolling its paths. On foot, you can discover your own personal power place, a spot that will pull you back time and time again. For me, that power spot is Central Park. It isn't just a destination; it's an embodiment of dreams, an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers, wherever we are from.

Biotech in the City that Never Sleeps

As an international student from Mumbai, India, I relocated to New York City for graduate studies because of the boundless opportunities it offers. New York and Mumbai are cities that never sleep, with nonstop access to lights, people and food.

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship, which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School. The curriculum integrates real-world projects, providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure. From the very beginning, I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship, offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career.

Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful, providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship, and Dr. Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions, respectively. Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty.

In addition to my studies, I’m a research assistant under Dr. Margarita Vigodner, professor of biology at YU’s Stern College for Women, studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells. In her lab, we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation. This helps us to validate some of the identified targets, which play an important role in spermatogenesis, as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells. We used gel-electrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins. Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr. Vigodner, but I’ve also profited just from working beside an experienced and well-respected researcher.

Outside the lab, I serve as vice president of the . In this role, I’m able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture. Last fall, the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students, strengthening their networks, and increasing the size of their social circle. These events provided a much-needed opportunity for students to unwind and de-stress.



Personally, one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York City’s rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions. So far, I’ve visited Times Square, the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate.

My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides. Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn, and you will be amazed at the doors that will open.

My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of life-changing. After I graduate next year, I plan to become a life-sciences consultant, assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products. I hadn’t considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion. I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills, experiences and relationships I’ve gained at the Katz School.

Whenever there has been a storm, Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter, much like an umbrella.

Best NYC Study Spots

Even in New York City's bustling environment, you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation. For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience, exploring the city's arts, music, architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration.

Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the city's diverse offerings. Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study.

One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the Nepali-American community. With 500 of my countrymen looking on, NYC's Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eight-foot-tall Nepali flag in Manhattan’s Bowling Green Park, in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center.

New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network, which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York City’s South Asian communities. It was quite a moment. because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud.

I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva University's reputation for educational excellence, the abundance of economic opportunity, and because it’s home to 70,000 Nepalese immigrants.



Here are my favorite study spots in New York City:

1. ****(476 5th Ave at 42nd Street) — My top pick for inspiring study spaces, New York City's flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions.

2. (in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets) — If studying outdoors is your thing, be sure to check out this 15-acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park.

3. **** (197 E. 3rd St.) — Great independent bookstore and bar in the East Village.

4.  (Beren Campus, 245 Lexington Ave) — Great place for quiet study and research support. You can also reserve private group study rooms.

5. **** (126 Crosby St.) — An institution in the Soho neighborhood with a cafe and amazing collection of used books,

Finding Influencer Success

My initial foray into the world of marketing led me to a school that left me feeling unfulfilled. The theories and concepts were there, but the hands-on experience I craved was missing. Determined to find the right fit, I explored various schools and that's when I found the Katz School.

Enrolling at the Katz School was a turning point in my pursuit of becoming a digital influencer. The Katz School's dynamic courses and practical approach not only equipped me with necessary technical skills but also fostered a creative environment that fueled my aspirations. With each class, I could feel myself evolving into a digital marketing maestro.



I aspire to impact the fashion industry significantly and to work with big brands in New York City. Now that I'm here, my dreams are bigger than ever. The cityscape has became my canvas. From the iconic streets of Times Square to the hidden gems in Brooklyn, every corner of New York City has become a backdrop for my content. Armed with my newfound skills, I've confidently pitched myself to brands I admired. In the heart of New York City, I've found my stage. With each post, video and collaboration, I was not just building a brand, I was becoming one.

Reflecting on My Journey

A Letter of Gratitude to Yeshiva University’s Katz School of Science and Health

I can officially say that I am a graduate of the Katz School of Health and hold an M.S. in Digital Marketing and Media. With my diploma in hand, I am overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude and a flood of memories.

I am thankful to the Katz School staff for their dedication to creating a nurturing and efficient educational environment, which played a crucial role in enhancing our academic and social experiences and made our journey both smooth and enjoyable.

Together, we navigated the rigors of academia, celebrated our triumphs and built lasting relationships that I will forever cherish.

Cybersecurity beyond Borders

Growing up in Colombia, I always had a curiosity for the world beyond my own borders. So, when the opportunity arose to study abroad, there was no hesitation. New York City, with its bustling streets and melting pot of cultures, called out to me. It's the capital of diversity, a place where you can meet people from every corner of the globe. Studying in such an environment promised growth, both personally and professionally, and I couldn't resist.

Choosing the Katz School of Science and Health was a no-brainer. The Katz School offers a curriculum tailored to individual needs, with faculty who truly engage with their students. As an international student, feeling connected to my instructors and peers was essential, and the Katz School delivered. Renowned for its excellence, it was the perfect fit for my graduate studies.

In the cybersecurity program, I found a community of like-minded individuals, many of whom, like me, came from abroad. The program's emphasis on real-world applicability and networking events like Cybertech provided invaluable experiences. Each class discussion was enriched by the diverse perspectives we all brought to the table.

If I had to pick a favorite class, it would be Security Architecture with Professor Nicole Becher. Exploring the intricacies of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has been both fascinating and eye-opening. Professor Becher's passion for the subject is contagious, making every lecture a stimulating experience.

Outside of academics, I love immersing myself in the vibrant life of New York City. Bryant Park, with its Winter Village, holds a special place in my heart. And who can forget 230 Rooftop, a favorite hangout spot from my undergrad days? There's never a dull moment in this city, and I make sure to savor every opportunity it offers.

My interest in cybersecurity extends beyond the classroom. My research project on IoT highlighted the pressing need for better security measures in an increasingly connected world. As society embraces technologies like Electric Vehicles, the risks of hacking become all too real.

Currently, I'm working as a Finance, Data Analytics, and Accounting Peer Tutor and Teaching Assistant. It's incredibly rewarding to help fellow students navigate these complex subjects and witness their learning journey unfold.

My dream job as a CIA Digital Forensics Engineer aligns perfectly with my passion for safeguarding against cyber threats and contributing to a safer future. In a world where cyber-attacks are a looming threat, I'm determined to play my part in fortifying our defenses. With the skills and knowledge gained from Katz School of Science and Health, I'm ready to tackle the challenges ahead and make a difference in the field of cybersecurity.

Parisian Flair meets New York Hustle

I'm Diane Schrenzel, originally from Paris, France, now pursuing my M.S. in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health in NYC. Alongside my studies, I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup. My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm, crafting strategies for success.

My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating. After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College, I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major, another passion of mine.

Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan, leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years. This role solidified my interest in business and marketing, prompting me to pursue my master’s degree at the Katz School of Science and Health.

New York City's vibrant atmosphere and cultural richness have always drawn me in, reminiscent of the energy I love about Paris. The bustling cityscape, combined with Katz School's diverse student body and esteemed faculty, made it an easy choice for me.

My favorite spot in the city is Angelina, a French cafe nestled in Bryant Park, where I indulge in their delectable pastries and signature Mont-Blanc. For a dose of culture, I frequent the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reveling in its ever-changing exhibits.

What I appreciate most about the Katz School is its inclusivity and the wealth of real-world experience offered by the professors. The personalized attention and supportive environment have truly made me feel at home.

Web analytics, taught by Professor Sivie Naimer, stands out as my favorite class. Her holistic approach to data analysis has equipped me with invaluable skills, which I've already applied in my new role at the startup. Professor Naimer's guidance has been instrumental in navigating the challenges of my current position, highlighting the practicality and relevance of the Katz School's curriculum.

My journey at the Katz School has been enriching, empowering me to thrive both academically and professionally in the dynamic landscape of digital marketing.

YU's Chinese-Jewish Conversation

YU’s Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) is a unique program designed to build a cultural bridge between the Chinese and Jewish communities and to provide a welcome space for Chinese students in New York City. The program sponsors periodic comparative seminars by Chinese and Jewish scholars, along with celebrations of significant cultural festivals such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and informal gatherings of students, alumni, and professionals to enhance academic and cultural connections. Here’s a retrospective look at one of its most popular annual events—a recent celebration of the Chinese New Year.

## Chinese New Year Celebration 2024: Year of the Dragon

_By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao_



The Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus’ Yagoda Commons.  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities. The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions, music, games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine. For Yining Zhang, a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing, the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad. He noted that “it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the world—and to learn about the Jewish New Year!""

For Chinese students far from home, the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community. Known also as the ""Spring Festival,"" the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture. Culminating in the Lantern Festival, it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two.

Ms. Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr. Mordechai Cohen, the Director of the CJC. Dr. Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare. He explained that the Jewish New Year, Rosh haShanah, is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar. In contrast, the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice. Interestingly, this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevat—specifically, the New Year for Trees, a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud. Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon, or Tu Bi-Shevat (the 15th of Shevat), which coincides with China's Lantern Festival. Dr. Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence: these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year, as they did in 2023, and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year.



After the lecture, an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience, with prizes awarded to the winners. Some of the Chinese participants, including Ms. He, were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year. The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture.

No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song, and the evening was no exception, with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics. The audience was particularly moved when Dr. Cohen, accompanied by his son Elisha (YUHSB '24), performed a beloved traditional Chinese song, “The Moon Represents My Heart.” The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns, with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures. Elisha, who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir, also shared Hebrew songs, adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening.



The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games, including ""lucky draw"" and a ""chopsticks ping-pong ball"" competition. With the latter, the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students. The winners received traditional ""Red Packets"" with a gift card.

The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended.  For Stern College student, Breindy Berger, the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful.  “I found the quiz fascinating and the ping-pong game a lot of fun!"" Chaya Goldberger, her classmate, added, ""I learned how to say 'Happy New Year' in Chinese from my new friend, Xinyue Huang! It was such a fantastic event.” Wei Luo, a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School, expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr. Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration. “It allowed us Chinese students studying abroad to feel the festival's warmth and blessings!""



Loretta Ching'andu

From Zambia to the UN

For as long as I can remember, I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something, where young girls can dream without limits, where voices from the margins are heard at the center, and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is.

But life has also taught me that belief alone isn’t enough. It takes action. It takes showing up, even when you’re unsure. It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there.

From my early advocacy years, I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change. I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa (CYLA), When Females Lead, and Girls Gone Political. These organizations pushed me, refined me, and prepared me for bigger moments to come. They taught me that no seat at the table is too big, no stage too grand, and no issue too complex for young people to lead on.



On February 5, 2025, I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters, leading a high-level session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5: Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum. As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY) Gender Youth Caucus, I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time.

The company was both humbling and inspiring. I was privileged to be joined by: H.E. Ambassador Al-Wasil – Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women; Shawyn Patterson-Howard – Mayor of Mount Vernon, New York; Aarushi Khanna – Asia-Pacific Regional Lead, Equal Measures 2030; Foteini Papagioti – Deputy Director of Policy & Advocacy, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW); Olela Tonny – Gender Expert, Child Protection & SRHR Advocate; and Diene Keita – Deputy Executive Director of Programme, UNFPA.

The conversation was urgent, necessary, and deeply personal. We discussed barriers women and girls still face, the financing gaps for gender equality, and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact. And how the world cannot afford to sideline women’s voices, expertise, and leadership any longer because when women lead, communities thrive, economies grow, and societies become more just.

In my years of advocacy, I’ve also learned that sometimes, proximity is everything. Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard.

A year ago, I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time, never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open. Today, I find myself leading conversations that shape the future.

But this is not just my story. It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream. It is the story of every young advocate, every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be. Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem. They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work, to the learning, to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens.

This is why I do what I do.

**Name:** Loretta Ching’andu

**Hometown:** Kabwe, Zambia

**Favorite Class:** Influencer Marketing

**Favorite Professor:** Too many to choose from, but Professor Joseph Panzarella has been incredibly impactful on my studies

**Advice for Incoming Students:** Be open-minded and very intentional. Network with as many people as you can, but don’t just be everywhere—align yourself with opportunities that match your passions. Stay grounded in what you believe in.

**Favorite Spot in NYC:** UN Headquarters, because it's a place that reminds me why I do this work

**NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home:** The Katz School itself feels a lot like home :)



Yining Zhang

Dreaming Big in NYC

Hey there! I’m Yining from the beautiful Yunnan Province in China. I took the leap to study abroad because I was super curious about exploring different cultures and diving into new experiences.

Why Yeshiva University’s Katz School? It’s simple—this place has a stellar biotech program, a super diverse group of classmates, and it's in New York City! If you're even a bit interested, my advice? Just go for it!

My favorite class has got to be Biotechnology Management. It’s not every day you get to learn directly from folks who are rocking it in the biotech world. We’ve had a bunch of guest lecturers share the ins and outs of the industry, and it’s been nothing short of inspiring. I was also taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed Finance for Startups and Entrepreneurial Ventures. Finance isn’t really my jam, but this course opened my eyes to the nuts and bolts of financial planning—crucial info for anyone looking to commercialize new tech.



One of the coolest parts of my journey here has been joining professor Ran Drori’s biochemistry lab as a research assistant. We’re exploring antifreeze proteins and their potential to stop ice from forming at low temps—which holds potential for revolutionizing food preservation. This is the kind of hands-on experience that’s gearing me up for my dream—pursuing a PhD.

Living in NYC is as great as it sounds. Walking by the Empire State Building daily never gets old. The lights, the buzz—it’s magical. And yeah, the city’s expensive, but trust me, it’s totally manageable with a bit of savvy budgeting.

My advice for new students? Stay curious and find your passion. Dive into group projects, network through professional events, and get real experience in labs. These are your golden tickets to wherever you want to go next. So, to all the future students out there—dream big, get involved, and embrace your adventure here. You’ve got this!

**生物学生聚光灯：张怡宁**

**技术管理与创业硕士，2025届 - 耶史瓦大学科学与健康卡茨学院**

大家好！我是来自中国云南的张怡宁。从小我就对世界万物充满了好奇心，希望长大后有机会探索体验不同国家和城市的生活。高中毕业我选择了从云南到北京，在北京中医药大学度过了充满活力的四年。毕业后我依旧充满好奇心的选择了留学美国。如果问我为什么选择就读耶史瓦大学卡茨学院？理由很简单，因为这里的生物技术项目设计非常前沿，学生群体多样化，同时相比同等大学昂贵的学费，卡茨的性价比更高。并且，这是纽约市呀！一个非常多元化的大都市。

硕士期间，我最喜欢的课程是生物技术管理，这门课的亮点是教授邀请了很多来自生物技术领域的嘉宾，对于像我这样的职场小白，有更多近距离与专业人士的机会，通过课上的互动可以快速了解该领域的前沿发展与挑战，非常鼓舞人心，最重要的部分是可以拓宽未来职业规划的赛道选择。除此之外，在卡茨我第一次接触到创业风险财务管理相关课程，我一直认为自己对财务领域不感兴趣，但是通过该课程的学习，出乎意料的发现了自己的新兴趣领域。通过进一步学习，我也深刻意识到财务规划与管理的重要性，尤其是对于任何希望将新技术商品化的企业或个人。

在卡茨学院，最幸运的事情应该是加入了Ran Drori教授的生物化学实验室，成功的成为一名研究助理。目前，我们正在研究抗冻蛋白及其在低温下阻止冰形成的潜力，也许不久的将来可能会成为下一个创新的食品保存技术！通过这段实验室经历，也让我坚定了下一步攻读博士学位的决心。

在卡茨学院除了忙碌的学习之外，我非常喜欢纽约这个充满活力的城市。生活在纽约每天都会遇到各种新鲜的事物，比如放学途中路过帝国大厦，每天都是不同的灯光主题，永远看不腻。谈起纽约，我相信很多人都会担忧高昂的生活成本，所以不得不放弃。的确，这个城市生活成本真的很高，但是请相信我，只要精打细算完全可以有效控制你的生活成本。

最后我想对未来的学弟学妹们一点儿建议，希望你们能一直保持好奇心，不断尝试寻找自己喜欢且擅长的领域。同时建议大家积极参与学校以及纽约市的各类团队项目，不断拓展自己的人脉，为自己的未来添砖加瓦。相信自己。你们可以做到的！

Runway Dreams

**From Social Media Influencing to NY Fashion Week**

Hello everyone! I’m thrilled to introduce myself. I'm a digital marketing and media student who recently moved to the vibrant city of New York from Jharkhand, India. The energy here is palpable, and every corner seems to hold a new adventure. From the iconic skyline to the endless cultural experiences, I am constantly inspired by everything NYC has to offer.

My adventure in social media began seven years ago when I decided to share my passion with the world. Starting with just 1,000 followers, I posted about my love for lifestyle, travel, beauty, and fashion. I remember feeling a rush every time someone liked or commented on my posts.

It was a slow climb, but I was determined to grow my community. Through trial and error, I learned the ins and outs of social media all on my own. I spent countless hours researching trends, experimenting with different types of content, and engaging with my followers. I embraced my authenticity, sharing my unique story, and it paid off—I eventually grew my Instagram follower count (@missfashioncupid) to over 100,000!



Once I arrived in NYC, that growth had no limit. Just a highlight: I got the incredible opportunity to go to New York Fashion Week 2024 as a Creator Guest for Runway 7 and to walk as a model for the brand ELJ Avenue and the Indian brand KHOOB at NYFW.

Reflecting on my social media journey, I’ve learned some valuable lessons. Here are my top three secrets to becoming an influencer:

— **Authenticity is Key:** People crave real stories. When I started sharing my true self, my audience began to connect with me on a deeper level.

**—****Consistency Matters:** I learned that posting regularly is crucial. By staying engaged with my followers, I built trust and loyalty, turning casual viewers into a supportive community.

**—****Master the Tools:** Familiarizing myself with various platforms and analytical tools helped me understand what worked best for my audience, guiding my growth.

**The Power of Networking**

One of the most significant lessons I’ve learned is the power of networking. Every connection I’ve made has opened new doors—whether for collaborations, friendships, or mentorships. I've made it a priority to attend workshops, social gatherings, school and academic events and NYC happenings, like pop-ups, brand parties, launches, and store invitations. These events have enriched my experience and allowed me to meet inspiring individuals who motivate me to grow. These events have also deepened my understanding of the marketing culture in the U.S. and helped me network and connect with more people and brands.

Sometimes, it can be tiring to attend all these events, but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward. I realize this is something I can’t afford to tire of; it’s too important for my growth and journey!

For new students like me, the fast-paced NYC environment can be a bit overwhelming. Here are a few tricks to help you stay connected and involved:



**—****Follow Local Influencers:** They often share events and hidden gems that might otherwise slip under the radar. Their insights are invaluable!

**—****Use Event Apps:** Platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup are my go-to for finding local happenings and networking opportunities. I also recommend secret nyc and nycbucketlist.

**—****Join University Groups:** Follow school’s newsletter to stay updated with what's happening in and around the campus and the city. And keep an eye on the school's and clubs' social media pages, which often highlight events around campus and in the city, making it easier to get involved.

**Looking Ahead**

As my graduate studies in this vibrant city come to an end, I find myself dreaming about the future. I’m passionate about social media marketing and see it as a perfect blend of creativity and strategy. I envision myself working with brands that align with my values, helping them elevate their online presence.

The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies, analyze consumer behavior, and apply data-driven insights—all of which I've started integrating into my influencer work. These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goals—creating win-win partnerships.

As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC, I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me: the professors, the classmates, the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey. The path ahead is full of potential, and I’m excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing.

For those just starting their journey, remember to embrace your authenticity, keep learning, and harness the power of networking. Let’s make the most of this incredible city together, chasing dreams, and creating connections along the way. Here’s to new adventures!

Global Citizen

From the bustling streets of Harare, Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City, my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery. Growing up in Zimbabwe, a country rich in culture and resilience, I embarked on a career in banking, starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller. Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact. My story is also one of adaptation and growth, from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing, driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change.

Today, I am immersed in the world of digital marketing and media at Katz School of Science and Health. My inspiration to pursue my master's in digital media came from observing my former employer's transformation into a digital bank in Zimbabwe. Witnessing this evolution ignited my curiosity about how digital innovations can reshape industries globally.

Choosing the Katz School was a natural fit for me. Its diverse culture, which I discovered while browsing the school's website, and its prime location in the heart of New York City—a place I've always dreamed of living—made it feel surreal.

In addition to my studies, I serve as a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing, where I guide international students in choosing their programs and schools, helping them secure funding for their education. By combining my financial sector experience with my growing knowledge in digital marketing and media, I aim to offer invaluable support to students navigating their academic journeys.

My favorite class is Consumer Behavior. Coming from a finance background, I lacked knowledge about utilizing consumer behavior in developing marketing strategies. This class has been enlightening, and our professor, Sivia Naimer, is incredibly engaging, friendly, and caring, making the learning experience even more enjoyable.

My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to me—freedom, opportunity, and a rich, diverse history. Coming from Harare, I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings.

On the other hand, Central Park feels like home. It's my go-to place to escape the hustle and bustle, unwind, and enjoy some peace and tranquility. There's something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the city's energy in a way that's comforting and familiar.

My advice for incoming students is to embrace the rich tapestry of cultural diversity you'll encounter—it's one of the greatest assets you'll experience. Stay ahead academically by being proactive and disciplined in your studies, ensuring you build a solid foundation for your future. Managing your finances wisely is crucial; develop a budget and stick to it to avoid unnecessary stress. Surround yourself with a strong support network of friends, mentors, and advisors who will uplift and guide you. Prioritize your physical and mental health, as they are vital to your overall success and well-being. Take the time to explore and enjoy your new environment, as it will broaden your horizons and enrich your experience. Lastly, maintain a positive and resilient attitude, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and development. With these principles, you'll not only survive but thrive in this new chapter of your life.

Embarking on the journey to America is both exciting and challenging. As someone who has made this journey, I would like to share some tips to help you prepare and succeed:

**— Research and Plan Ahead:** Familiarize yourself with the visa process, university requirements, and the city you’ll be living in. Proper planning will help you avoid last-minute surprises.

**—** **Cultural Adaptation:** Embrace the cultural diversity and be open to learning. Engage with different cultures to enrich your experience and broaden your perspective.

**— Academic Preparedness:** Stay ahead in your studies by understanding the academic expectations and resources available. Make use of study groups, tutoring services, and office hours to excel in your coursework.

**— Financial Management:** Budget wisely. Understand the cost of living in your new city and manage your finances to avoid unnecessary stress. Look for part-time job opportunities that align with your visa regulations. As a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing, I can assist you with financial advice and resources tailored to international students.

**—** **Build a Support Network:** Connect with fellow students, join international student organizations, and participate in campus activities. Having a support network will make your transition smoother and your experience more enjoyable.

**— Stay Healthy:** Take care of your physical and mental health. Utilize university health services and maintain a balanced lifestyle to ensure you can perform your best academically and socially.

**— Explore and Enjoy:** Take time to explore your new environment and enjoy the unique experiences it offers. Visit local attractions, try new foods, and immerse yourself in the local culture.

**— Stay Positive and Resilient:** There will be challenges along the way but stay positive and resilient. Every experience, good or bad, is an opportunity to learn and grow. America is a land of opportunities, and with determination and preparation, you can achieve your dreams. Good luck on your journey!

Discovering the Magic of Central Park

I used to live in Siberia, where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bone-chilling 36 degrees below zero. Amid those harsh conditions, I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park, which I kept as my desktop screensaver. This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold, and it kindled a dream within me. I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree. Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize.

Last year, I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health, which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality. Central Park, once a distant daydream, now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams.

Every Sunday, I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty, enjoy a picnic, and soak up the atmosphere. Central Park, to me, has become more than just a scenic escape; it's a testament to the power of belief. It proves that dreams, no matter how big or seemingly impossible, can come true for those who refuse to give up.

**Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park:**

**\-**  **:** It's a wide-open field with a view of skyscrapers, perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends.

 **:** This historic structure is one of the first built in the park. I love walking here, admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians. Fun fact: you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2.

\-  **:** I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City. This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia, and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my once-impossible dream had come true.

**\-**  **:** One of the most iconic features of Central Park, this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake.

**\-**  **:** Also known as Central Park Reservoir, it covers a significant portion of the park's surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline.

Central Park isn't just a fair-weather friend. It boasts year-round attractions: cherry blossoms in the spring (between 72nd and 96th streets), ice-skating rinks in winter and biking in the summer.

To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and, indeed, New York City, there's no better way than strolling its paths. On foot, you can discover your own personal power place, a spot that will pull you back time and time again. For me, that power spot is Central Park. It isn't just a destination; it's an embodiment of dreams, an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers, wherever we are from.

Biotech in the City that Never Sleeps

As an international student from Mumbai, India, I relocated to New York City for graduate studies because of the boundless opportunities it offers. New York and Mumbai are cities that never sleep, with nonstop access to lights, people and food.

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship, which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School. The curriculum integrates real-world projects, providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure. From the very beginning, I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship, offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career.

Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful, providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship, and Dr. Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions, respectively. Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty.

In addition to my studies, I’m a research assistant under Dr. Margarita Vigodner, professor of biology at YU’s Stern College for Women, studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells. In her lab, we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation. This helps us to validate some of the identified targets, which play an important role in spermatogenesis, as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells. We used gel-electrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins. Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr. Vigodner, but I’ve also profited just from working beside an experienced and well-respected researcher.

Outside the lab, I serve as vice president of the . In this role, I’m able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture. Last fall, the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students, strengthening their networks, and increasing the size of their social circle. These events provided a much-needed opportunity for students to unwind and de-stress.



Personally, one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York City’s rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions. So far, I’ve visited Times Square, the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate.

My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides. Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn, and you will be amazed at the doors that will open.

My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of life-changing. After I graduate next year, I plan to become a life-sciences consultant, assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products. I hadn’t considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion. I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills, experiences and relationships I’ve gained at the Katz School.

**NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home:** I feel at home at the Katz School because of the kind and supportive atmosphere it offers. If you ever need somebody to cheer you on or join in on an activity, your professors and friends are always there. Most notably, Dr. Khan, Dr. Vigodner and Dr. Natasha were there for me through thick and thin. Whenever there has been a storm, Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter, much like an umbrella.

Best NYC Study Spots

Even in New York City's bustling environment, you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation. For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience, exploring the city's arts, music, architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration.

Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the city's diverse offerings. Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study.

One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the Nepali-American community. With 500 of my countrymen looking on, NYC's Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eight-foot-tall Nepali flag in Manhattan’s Bowling Green Park, in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center.

New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network, which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York City’s South Asian communities. It was quite a moment. because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud.

I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva University's reputation for educational excellence, the abundance of economic opportunity, and because it’s home to 70,000 Nepalese immigrants.



Here are my favorite study spots in New York City:

1. ****(476 5th Ave at 42nd Street) — My top pick for inspiring study spaces, New York City's flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions.

2. (in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets) — If studying outdoors is your thing, be sure to check out this 15-acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park.

3. **** (197 E. 3rd St.) — Great independent bookstore and bar in the East Village.

4.  (Beren Campus, 245 Lexington Ave) — Great place for quiet study and research support. You can also reserve private group study rooms.

5. **** (126 Crosby St.) — An institution in the Soho neighborhood with a cafe and amazing collection of used books,

Cybersecurity beyond Borders

Growing up in Colombia, I always had a curiosity for the world beyond my own borders. So, when the opportunity arose to study abroad, there was no hesitation. New York City, with its bustling streets and melting pot of cultures, called out to me. It's the capital of diversity, a place where you can meet people from every corner of the globe. Studying in such an environment promised growth, both personally and professionally, and I couldn't resist.

Choosing the Katz School of Science and Health was a no-brainer. The Katz School offers a curriculum tailored to individual needs, with faculty who truly engage with their students. As an international student, feeling connected to my instructors and peers was essential, and the Katz School delivered. Renowned for its excellence, it was the perfect fit for my graduate studies.

In the cybersecurity program, I found a community of like-minded individuals, many of whom, like me, came from abroad. The program's emphasis on real-world applicability and networking events like Cybertech provided invaluable experiences. Each class discussion was enriched by the diverse perspectives we all brought to the table.

If I had to pick a favorite class, it would be Security Architecture with Professor Nicole Becher. Exploring the intricacies of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has been both fascinating and eye-opening. Professor Becher's passion for the subject is contagious, making every lecture a stimulating experience.

Outside of academics, I love immersing myself in the vibrant life of New York City. Bryant Park, with its Winter Village, holds a special place in my heart. And who can forget 230 Rooftop, a favorite hangout spot from my undergrad days? There's never a dull moment in this city, and I make sure to savor every opportunity it offers.

My interest in cybersecurity extends beyond the classroom. My research project on IoT highlighted the pressing need for better security measures in an increasingly connected world. As society embraces technologies like Electric Vehicles, the risks of hacking become all too real.

Currently, I'm working as a Finance, Data Analytics, and Accounting Peer Tutor and Teaching Assistant. It's incredibly rewarding to help fellow students navigate these complex subjects and witness their learning journey unfold.

My dream job as a CIA Digital Forensics Engineer aligns perfectly with my passion for safeguarding against cyber threats and contributing to a safer future. In a world where cyber-attacks are a looming threat, I'm determined to play my part in fortifying our defenses. With the skills and knowledge gained from Katz School of Science and Health, I'm ready to tackle the challenges ahead and make a difference in the field of cybersecurity.

Parisian Flair meets New York Hustle

I'm Diane Schrenzel, originally from Paris, France, now pursuing my M.S. in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health in NYC. Alongside my studies, I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup. My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm, crafting strategies for success.

My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating. After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College, I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major, another passion of mine.

Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan, leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years. This role solidified my interest in business and marketing, prompting me to pursue my master’s degree at the Katz School of Science and Health.

New York City's vibrant atmosphere and cultural richness have always drawn me in, reminiscent of the energy I love about Paris. The bustling cityscape, combined with Katz School's diverse student body and esteemed faculty, made it an easy choice for me.

My favorite spot in the city is Angelina, a French cafe nestled in Bryant Park, where I indulge in their delectable pastries and signature Mont-Blanc. For a dose of culture, I frequent the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reveling in its ever-changing exhibits.

What I appreciate most about the Katz School is its inclusivity and the wealth of real-world experience offered by the professors. The personalized attention and supportive environment have truly made me feel at home.

Web analytics, taught by Professor Sivie Naimer, stands out as my favorite class. Her holistic approach to data analysis has equipped me with invaluable skills, which I've already applied in my new role at the startup. Professor Naimer's guidance has been instrumental in navigating the challenges of my current position, highlighting the practicality and relevance of the Katz School's curriculum.

My journey at the Katz School has been enriching, empowering me to thrive both academically and professionally in the dynamic landscape of digital marketing.

YU's Chinese-Jewish Conversation

YU’s Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) is a unique program designed to build a cultural bridge between the Chinese and Jewish communities and to provide a welcome space for Chinese students in New York City. The program sponsors periodic comparative seminars by Chinese and Jewish scholars, along with celebrations of significant cultural festivals such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and informal gatherings of students, alumni, and professionals to enhance academic and cultural connections. Here’s a retrospective look at one of its most popular annual events—a recent celebration of the Chinese New Year.

## Chinese New Year Celebration 2024: Year of the Dragon

_By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao_



The Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus’ Yagoda Commons.  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities. The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions, music, games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine. For Yining Zhang, a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing, the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad. He noted that “it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the world—and to learn about the Jewish New Year!""

For Chinese students far from home, the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community. Known also as the ""Spring Festival,"" the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture. Culminating in the Lantern Festival, it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two.

Ms. Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr. Mordechai Cohen, the Director of the CJC. Dr. Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare. He explained that the Jewish New Year, Rosh haShanah, is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar. In contrast, the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice. Interestingly, this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevat—specifically, the New Year for Trees, a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud. Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon, or Tu Bi-Shevat (the 15th of Shevat), which coincides with China's Lantern Festival. Dr. Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence: these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year, as they did in 2023, and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year.



After the lecture, an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience, with prizes awarded to the winners. Some of the Chinese participants, including Ms. He, were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year. The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture.

No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song, and the evening was no exception, with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics. The audience was particularly moved when Dr. Cohen, accompanied by his son Elisha (YUHSB '24), performed a beloved traditional Chinese song, “The Moon Represents My Heart.” The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns, with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures. Elisha, who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir, also shared Hebrew songs, adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening.



The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games, including ""lucky draw"" and a ""chopsticks ping-pong ball"" competition. With the latter, the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students. The winners received traditional ""Red Packets"" with a gift card.

The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended.  For Stern College student, Breindy Berger, the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful.  “I found the quiz fascinating and the ping-pong game a lot of fun!"" Chaya Goldberger, her classmate, added, ""I learned how to say 'Happy New Year' in Chinese from my new friend, Xinyue Huang! It was such a fantastic event.” Wei Luo, a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School, expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr. Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration. “It allowed us Chinese students studying abroad to feel the festival's warmth and blessings!""



Loretta Ching'andu

From Zambia to the UN

For as long as I can remember, I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something, where young girls can dream without limits, where voices from the margins are heard at the center, and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is.

But life has also taught me that belief alone isn’t enough. It takes action. It takes showing up, even when you’re unsure. It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there.

From my early advocacy years, I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change. I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa (CYLA), When Females Lead, and Girls Gone Political. These organizations pushed me, refined me, and prepared me for bigger moments to come. They taught me that no seat at the table is too big, no stage too grand, and no issue too complex for young people to lead on.



On February 5, 2025, I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters, leading a high-level session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5: Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum. As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY) Gender Youth Caucus, I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time.

The company was both humbling and inspiring. I was privileged to be joined by: H.E. Ambassador Al-Wasil – Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women; Shawyn Patterson-Howard – Mayor of Mount Vernon, New York; Aarushi Khanna – Asia-Pacific Regional Lead, Equal Measures 2030; Foteini Papagioti – Deputy Director of Policy & Advocacy, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW); Olela Tonny – Gender Expert, Child Protection & SRHR Advocate; and Diene Keita – Deputy Executive Director of Programme, UNFPA.

The conversation was urgent, necessary, and deeply personal. We discussed barriers women and girls still face, the financing gaps for gender equality, and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact. And how the world cannot afford to sideline women’s voices, expertise, and leadership any longer because when women lead, communities thrive, economies grow, and societies become more just.

In my years of advocacy, I’ve also learned that sometimes, proximity is everything. Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard.

A year ago, I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time, never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open. Today, I find myself leading conversations that shape the future.

But this is not just my story. It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream. It is the story of every young advocate, every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be. Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem. They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work, to the learning, to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens.

This is why I do what I do.

**Name:** Loretta Ching’andu

**Hometown:** Kabwe, Zambia

**Favorite Class:** Influencer Marketing

**Favorite Professor:** Too many to choose from, but Professor Joseph Panzarella has been incredibly impactful on my studies

**Advice for Incoming Students:** Be open-minded and very intentional. Network with as many people as you can, but don’t just be everywhere—align yourself with opportunities that match your passions. Stay grounded in what you believe in.

**Favorite Spot in NYC:** UN Headquarters, because it's a place that reminds me why I do this work

**NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home:** The Katz School itself feels a lot like home :)

Dreaming Big in NYC

Hey there! I’m Yining from the beautiful Yunnan Province in China. I took the leap to study abroad because I was super curious about exploring different cultures and diving into new experiences.

Why Yeshiva University’s Katz School? It’s simple—this place has a stellar biotech program, a super diverse group of classmates, and it's in New York City! If you're even a bit interested, my advice? Just go for it!

My favorite class has got to be Biotechnology Management. It’s not every day you get to learn directly from folks who are rocking it in the biotech world. We’ve had a bunch of guest lecturers share the ins and outs of the industry, and it’s been nothing short of inspiring. I was also taken by surprise at how much I enjoyed Finance for Startups and Entrepreneurial Ventures. Finance isn’t really my jam, but this course opened my eyes to the nuts and bolts of financial planning—crucial info for anyone looking to commercialize new tech.



One of the coolest parts of my journey here has been joining professor Ran Drori’s biochemistry lab as a research assistant. We’re exploring antifreeze proteins and their potential to stop ice from forming at low temps—which holds potential for revolutionizing food preservation. This is the kind of hands-on experience that’s gearing me up for my dream—pursuing a PhD.

Living in NYC is as great as it sounds. Walking by the Empire State Building daily never gets old. The lights, the buzz—it’s magical. And yeah, the city’s expensive, but trust me, it’s totally manageable with a bit of savvy budgeting.

My advice for new students? Stay curious and find your passion. Dive into group projects, network through professional events, and get real experience in labs. These are your golden tickets to wherever you want to go next. So, to all the future students out there—dream big, get involved, and embrace your adventure here. You’ve got this!

**生物学生聚光灯：张怡宁**

**技术管理与创业硕士，2025届 - 耶史瓦大学科学与健康卡茨学院**

大家好！我是来自中国云南的张怡宁。从小我就对世界万物充满了好奇心，希望长大后有机会探索体验不同国家和城市的生活。高中毕业我选择了从云南到北京，在北京中医药大学度过了充满活力的四年。毕业后我依旧充满好奇心的选择了留学美国。如果问我为什么选择就读耶史瓦大学卡茨学院？理由很简单，因为这里的生物技术项目设计非常前沿，学生群体多样化，同时相比同等大学昂贵的学费，卡茨的性价比更高。并且，这是纽约市呀！一个非常多元化的大都市。

硕士期间，我最喜欢的课程是生物技术管理，这门课的亮点是教授邀请了很多来自生物技术领域的嘉宾，对于像我这样的职场小白，有更多近距离与专业人士的机会，通过课上的互动可以快速了解该领域的前沿发展与挑战，非常鼓舞人心，最重要的部分是可以拓宽未来职业规划的赛道选择。除此之外，在卡茨我第一次接触到创业风险财务管理相关课程，我一直认为自己对财务领域不感兴趣，但是通过该课程的学习，出乎意料的发现了自己的新兴趣领域。通过进一步学习，我也深刻意识到财务规划与管理的重要性，尤其是对于任何希望将新技术商品化的企业或个人。

在卡茨学院，最幸运的事情应该是加入了Ran Drori教授的生物化学实验室，成功的成为一名研究助理。目前，我们正在研究抗冻蛋白及其在低温下阻止冰形成的潜力，也许不久的将来可能会成为下一个创新的食品保存技术！通过这段实验室经历，也让我坚定了下一步攻读博士学位的决心。

在卡茨学院除了忙碌的学习之外，我非常喜欢纽约这个充满活力的城市。生活在纽约每天都会遇到各种新鲜的事物，比如放学途中路过帝国大厦，每天都是不同的灯光主题，永远看不腻。谈起纽约，我相信很多人都会担忧高昂的生活成本，所以不得不放弃。的确，这个城市生活成本真的很高，但是请相信我，只要精打细算完全可以有效控制你的生活成本。

最后我想对未来的学弟学妹们一点儿建议，希望你们能一直保持好奇心，不断尝试寻找自己喜欢且擅长的领域。同时建议大家积极参与学校以及纽约市的各类团队项目，不断拓展自己的人脉，为自己的未来添砖加瓦。相信自己。你们可以做到的！

Runway Dreams

**From Social Media Influencing to NY Fashion Week**

Hello everyone! I’m thrilled to introduce myself. I'm a digital marketing and media student who recently moved to the vibrant city of New York from Jharkhand, India. The energy here is palpable, and every corner seems to hold a new adventure. From the iconic skyline to the endless cultural experiences, I am constantly inspired by everything NYC has to offer.

My adventure in social media began seven years ago when I decided to share my passion with the world. Starting with just 1,000 followers, I posted about my love for lifestyle, travel, beauty, and fashion. I remember feeling a rush every time someone liked or commented on my posts.

It was a slow climb, but I was determined to grow my community. Through trial and error, I learned the ins and outs of social media all on my own. I spent countless hours researching trends, experimenting with different types of content, and engaging with my followers. I embraced my authenticity, sharing my unique story, and it paid off—I eventually grew my Instagram follower count (@missfashioncupid) to over 100,000!



Once I arrived in NYC, that growth had no limit. Just a highlight: I got the incredible opportunity to go to New York Fashion Week 2024 as a Creator Guest for Runway 7 and to walk as a model for the brand ELJ Avenue and the Indian brand KHOOB at NYFW.

Reflecting on my social media journey, I’ve learned some valuable lessons. Here are my top three secrets to becoming an influencer:

— **Authenticity is Key:** People crave real stories. When I started sharing my true self, my audience began to connect with me on a deeper level.

**—****Consistency Matters:** I learned that posting regularly is crucial. By staying engaged with my followers, I built trust and loyalty, turning casual viewers into a supportive community.

**—****Master the Tools:** Familiarizing myself with various platforms and analytical tools helped me understand what worked best for my audience, guiding my growth.

**The Power of Networking**

One of the most significant lessons I’ve learned is the power of networking. Every connection I’ve made has opened new doors—whether for collaborations, friendships, or mentorships. I've made it a priority to attend workshops, social gatherings, school and academic events and NYC happenings, like pop-ups, brand parties, launches, and store invitations. These events have enriched my experience and allowed me to meet inspiring individuals who motivate me to grow. These events have also deepened my understanding of the marketing culture in the U.S. and helped me network and connect with more people and brands.

Sometimes, it can be tiring to attend all these events, but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward. I realize this is something I can’t afford to tire of; it’s too important for my growth and journey!

For new students like me, the fast-paced NYC environment can be a bit overwhelming. Here are a few tricks to help you stay connected and involved:



**—****Follow Local Influencers:** They often share events and hidden gems that might otherwise slip under the radar. Their insights are invaluable!

**—****Use Event Apps:** Platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup are my go-to for finding local happenings and networking opportunities. I also recommend secret nyc and nycbucketlist.

**—****Join University Groups:** Follow school’s newsletter to stay updated with what's happening in and around the campus and the city. And keep an eye on the school's and clubs' social media pages, which often highlight events around campus and in the city, making it easier to get involved.

**Looking Ahead**

As my graduate studies in this vibrant city come to an end, I find myself dreaming about the future. I’m passionate about social media marketing and see it as a perfect blend of creativity and strategy. I envision myself working with brands that align with my values, helping them elevate their online presence.

The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies, analyze consumer behavior, and apply data-driven insights—all of which I've started integrating into my influencer work. These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goals—creating win-win partnerships.

As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC, I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me: the professors, the classmates, the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey. The path ahead is full of potential, and I’m excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing.

For those just starting their journey, remember to embrace your authenticity, keep learning, and harness the power of networking. Let’s make the most of this incredible city together, chasing dreams, and creating connections along the way. Here’s to new adventures!

Global Citizen

From the bustling streets of Harare, Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City, my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery. Growing up in Zimbabwe, a country rich in culture and resilience, I embarked on a career in banking, starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller. Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact. My story is also one of adaptation and growth, from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing, driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change.

Today, I am immersed in the world of digital marketing and media at Katz School of Science and Health. My inspiration to pursue my master's in digital media came from observing my former employer's transformation into a digital bank in Zimbabwe. Witnessing this evolution ignited my curiosity about how digital innovations can reshape industries globally.

Choosing the Katz School was a natural fit for me. Its diverse culture, which I discovered while browsing the school's website, and its prime location in the heart of New York City—a place I've always dreamed of living—made it feel surreal.

In addition to my studies, I serve as a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing, where I guide international students in choosing their programs and schools, helping them secure funding for their education. By combining my financial sector experience with my growing knowledge in digital marketing and media, I aim to offer invaluable support to students navigating their academic journeys.

My favorite class is Consumer Behavior. Coming from a finance background, I lacked knowledge about utilizing consumer behavior in developing marketing strategies. This class has been enlightening, and our professor, Sivia Naimer, is incredibly engaging, friendly, and caring, making the learning experience even more enjoyable.

My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to me—freedom, opportunity, and a rich, diverse history. Coming from Harare, I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings.

On the other hand, Central Park feels like home. It's my go-to place to escape the hustle and bustle, unwind, and enjoy some peace and tranquility. There's something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the city's energy in a way that's comforting and familiar.

My advice for incoming students is to embrace the rich tapestry of cultural diversity you'll encounter—it's one of the greatest assets you'll experience. Stay ahead academically by being proactive and disciplined in your studies, ensuring you build a solid foundation for your future. Managing your finances wisely is crucial; develop a budget and stick to it to avoid unnecessary stress. Surround yourself with a strong support network of friends, mentors, and advisors who will uplift and guide you. Prioritize your physical and mental health, as they are vital to your overall success and well-being. Take the time to explore and enjoy your new environment, as it will broaden your horizons and enrich your experience. Lastly, maintain a positive and resilient attitude, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and development.

Discovering the Magic of Central Park

I used to live in Siberia, where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bone-chilling 36 degrees below zero. Amid those harsh conditions, I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park, which I kept as my desktop screensaver. This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold, and it kindled a dream within me. I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree. Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize.

Last year, I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health, which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality. Central Park, once a distant daydream, now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams.

Every Sunday, I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty, enjoy a picnic, and soak up the atmosphere. Central Park, to me, has become more than just a scenic escape; it's a testament to the power of belief. It proves that dreams, no matter how big or seemingly impossible, can come true for those who refuse to give up.

**Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park:**

**\-**  **:** It's a wide-open field with a view of skyscrapers, perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends.

 **:** This historic structure is one of the first built in the park. I love walking here, admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians. Fun fact: you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2.

\-  **:** I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City. This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia, and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my once-impossible dream had come true.

**\-**  **:** One of the most iconic features of Central Park, this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake.

**\-**  **:** Also known as Central Park Reservoir, it covers a significant portion of the park's surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline.

Central Park isn't just a fair-weather friend. It boasts year-round attractions: cherry blossoms in the spring (between 72nd and 96th streets), ice-skating rinks in winter and biking in the summer.

To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and, indeed, New York City, there's no better way than strolling its paths. On foot, you can discover your own personal power place, a spot that will pull you back time and time again. For me, that power spot is Central Park. It isn't just a destination; it's an embodiment of dreams, an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers, wherever we are from.

Biotech in the City that Never Sleeps

As an international student from Mumbai, India, I relocated to New York City for graduate studies because of the boundless opportunities it offers. New York and Mumbai are cities that never sleep, with nonstop access to lights, people and food.

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship, which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School. The curriculum integrates real-world projects, providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure. From the very beginning, I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship, offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career.

Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful, providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship, and Dr. Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions, respectively. Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty.

In addition to my studies, I’m a research assistant under Dr. Margarita Vigodner, professor of biology at YU’s Stern College for Women, studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells. In her lab, we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation. This helps us to validate some of the identified targets, which play an important role in spermatogenesis, as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells. We used gel-electrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins. Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr. Vigodner, but I’ve also profited just from working beside an experienced and well-respected researcher.

Outside the lab, I serve as vice president of the . In this role, I’m able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture. Last fall, the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students, strengthening their networks, and increasing the size of their social circle. These events provided a much-needed opportunity for students to unwind and de-stress.



Personally, one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York City’s rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions. So far, I’ve visited Times Square, the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park and St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate.

My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides. Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn, and you will be amazed at the doors that will open.

My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of life-changing. After I graduate next year, I plan to become a life-sciences consultant, assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products. I hadn’t considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion. I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills, experiences and relationships I’ve gained at the Katz School.

Whenever there has been a storm, Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter, much like an umbrella.

Best NYC Study Spots

Even in New York City's bustling environment, you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation. For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience, exploring the city's arts, music, architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration.

Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the city's diverse offerings. Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study.

One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the Nepali-American community. With 500 of my countrymen looking on, NYC's Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eight-foot-tall Nepali flag in Manhattan’s Bowling Green Park, in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center.

New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network, which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York City’s South Asian communities. It was quite a moment. because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud.

I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva University's reputation for educational excellence, the abundance of economic opportunity, and because it’s home to 70,000 Nepalese immigrants.



Here are my favorite study spots in New York City:

1. ****(476 5th Ave at 42nd Street) — My top pick for inspiring study spaces, New York City's flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions.

2. (in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets) — If studying outdoors is your thing, be sure to check out this 15-acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park.

3. **** (197 E. 3rd St.) — Great independent bookstore and bar in the East Village.

4.  (Beren Campus, 245 Lexington Ave) — Great place for quiet study and research support. You can also reserve private group study rooms.

5. **** (126 Crosby St.) — An institution in the Soho neighborhood with a cafe and amazing collection of used books,

Cybersecurity beyond Borders

Growing up in Colombia, I always had a curiosity for the world beyond my own borders. So, when the opportunity arose to study abroad, there was no hesitation. New York City, with its bustling streets and melting pot of cultures, called out to me. It's the capital of diversity, a place where you can meet people from every corner of the globe. Studying in such an environment promised growth, both personally and professionally, and I couldn't resist.

Choosing the Katz School of Science and Health was a no-brainer. The Katz School offers a curriculum tailored to individual needs, with faculty who truly engage with their students. As an international student, feeling connected to my instructors and peers was essential, and the Katz School delivered. Renowned for its excellence, it was the perfect fit for my graduate studies.

In the cybersecurity program, I found a community of like-minded individuals, many of whom, like me, came from abroad. The program's emphasis on real-world applicability and networking events like Cybertech provided invaluable experiences. Each class discussion was enriched by the diverse perspectives we all brought to the table.

If I had to pick a favorite class, it would be Security Architecture with Professor Nicole Becher. Exploring the intricacies of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud has been both fascinating and eye-opening. Professor Becher's passion for the subject is contagious, making every lecture a stimulating experience.

Outside of academics, I love immersing myself in the vibrant life of New York City. Bryant Park, with its Winter Village, holds a special place in my heart. And who can forget 230 Rooftop, a favorite hangout spot from my undergrad days? There's never a dull moment in this city, and I make sure to savor every opportunity it offers.

My interest in cybersecurity extends beyond the classroom. My research project on IoT highlighted the pressing need for better security measures in an increasingly connected world. As society embraces technologies like Electric Vehicles, the risks of hacking become all too real.

Currently, I'm working as a Finance, Data Analytics, and Accounting Peer Tutor and Teaching Assistant. It's incredibly rewarding to help fellow students navigate these complex subjects and witness their learning journey unfold.

My dream job as a CIA Digital Forensics Engineer aligns perfectly with my passion for safeguarding against cyber threats and contributing to a safer future. In a world where cyber-attacks are a looming threat, I'm determined to play my part in fortifying our defenses. With the skills and knowledge gained from Katz School of Science and Health, I'm ready to tackle the challenges ahead and make a difference in the field of cybersecurity.

Parisian Flair meets New York Hustle

I'm Diane Schrenzel, originally from Paris, France, now pursuing my M.S. in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health in NYC. Alongside my studies, I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup. My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm, crafting strategies for success.

My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating. After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College, I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major, another passion of mine.

Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan, leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years. This role solidified my interest in business and marketing, prompting me to pursue my master’s degree at the Katz School of Science and Health.

New York City's vibrant atmosphere and cultural richness have always drawn me in, reminiscent of the energy I love about Paris. The bustling cityscape, combined with Katz School's diverse student body and esteemed faculty, made it an easy choice for me.

My favorite spot in the city is Angelina, a French cafe nestled in Bryant Park, where I indulge in their delectable pastries and signature Mont-Blanc. For a dose of culture, I frequent the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reveling in its ever-changing exhibits.

What I appreciate most about the Katz School is its inclusivity and the wealth of real-world experience offered by the professors. The personalized attention and supportive environment have truly made me feel at home.

Web analytics, taught by Professor Sivie Naimer, stands out as my favorite class. Her holistic approach to data analysis has equipped me with invaluable skills, which I've already applied in my new role at the startup. Professor Naimer's guidance has been instrumental in navigating the challenges of my current position, highlighting the practicality and relevance of the Katz School's curriculum.

My journey at the Katz School has been enriching, empowering me to thrive both academically and professionally in the dynamic landscape of digital marketing.

YU's Chinese-Jewish Conversation

YU’s Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) is a unique program designed to build a cultural bridge between the Chinese and Jewish communities and to provide a welcome space for Chinese students in New York City. The program sponsors periodic comparative seminars by Chinese and Jewish scholars, along with celebrations of significant cultural festivals such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, and informal gatherings of students, alumni, and professionals to enhance academic and cultural connections. Here’s a retrospective look at one of its most popular annual events—a recent celebration of the Chinese New Year.

## Chinese New Year Celebration 2024: Year of the Dragon

_By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao_



The Chinese-Jewish Conversation (CJC) and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus’ Yagoda Commons.  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities. The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions, music, games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine. For Yining Zhang, a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing, the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad. He noted that “it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the world—and to learn about the Jewish New Year!""

For Chinese students far from home, the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community. Known also as the ""Spring Festival,"" the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture. Culminating in the Lantern Festival, it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two.

Ms. Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr. Mordechai Cohen, the Director of the CJC. Dr. Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare. He explained that the Jewish New Year, Rosh haShanah, is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar. In contrast, the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice. Interestingly, this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevat—specifically, the New Year for Trees, a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud. Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon, or Tu Bi-Shevat (the 15th of Shevat), which coincides with China's Lantern Festival. Dr. Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence: these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year, as they did in 2023, and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year.



After the lecture, an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience, with prizes awarded to the winners. Some of the Chinese participants, including Ms. He, were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year. The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture.

No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song, and the evening was no exception, with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics. The audience was particularly moved when Dr. Cohen, accompanied by his son Elisha (YUHSB '24), performed a beloved traditional Chinese song, “The Moon Represents My Heart.” The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns, with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures. Elisha, who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir, also shared Hebrew songs, adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening.



The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games, including ""lucky draw"" and a ""chopsticks ping-pong ball"" competition. With the latter, the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students. The winners received traditional ""Red Packets"" with a gift card.

The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended.  For Stern College student, Breindy Berger, the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful.  “I found the quiz fascinating and the ping-pong game a lot of fun!"" Chaya Goldberger, her classmate, added, ""I learned how to say 'Happy New Year' in Chinese from my new friend, Xinyue Huang! It was such a fantastic event.” Wei Luo, a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School, expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr. Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration. “It allowed us Chinese students studying abroad to feel the festival's warmth and blessings!""
