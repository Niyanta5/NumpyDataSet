Market Analysis Finds Commercial Promise for Cancer Drug
Avi Strauss a recent Katz School biotech graduate has performed a detailed market analysis on a new drug therapy for colorectal cancer
The analysis recommended that Sapience Therapeutics a New Yorkbased biotech company develop a molecule called a novel betacatenin antagonist for treatment of the cancer Betacatenin is part of the Wnt signaling pathway which promotes tumor growth and suppresses the immune system
In addition to colorectal cancer Strauss reviewed four other types of cancer that have high mortality rates and resist conventional therapies acute lymphocytic leukemia breast cancer melanoma and multiple myeloma
He found that colorectal cancer patients would be a prime population for Sapiences novel peptide because of the high incidence of a mutation in the Wnt signaling pathway that results in its overactivation and leads to the formation of cancer Colorectal cancer presents the highest upside according to the revenue projection model said Strauss who is a healthcare consultant for the Marwood Group and presents the largest potential available population among the five cancer types studied
Sapiences therapeutic approach according to Dr Kappel is to target proteinprotein interactions PPIs that seem necessary to the survival of cancer or that inhibit the immune systems response to cancerous tumors The interactions targeted by Sapience are considered undruggable due to the intracellular location of the PPIs making them difficult to treat with smallmolecule drugs such as chemotherapies that are incapable of disrupting PPIs and biologicbased drugs like monoclonal antibodies that are too big to enter cells
Peptides combine the best properties of small and large molecules said Dr Kappel and present an opportunity to disrupt intracellular PPIs and to reduce mortality in cancer patients and possibly in other diseases
Robert Friedman an adjunct professor in the biotechnology program and Strausss advisor said that Strausss presentation demonstrates the strength of the moleculetomarket nature of the Katz Schools biotechnology program and its emphasis on understanding the science and translating it into practical and actionable decisions
Avis understanding of the science clinical development and the market were all critical to successfully completing the project he said The piece de resistance of his elegant work is undoubtedly the market forecast model that the client will incorporate in its corporate planning process for years to come

Complex Systems Lab
Making the World Smarter Safer and Healthier
Welcome
Many reallife systems encountered in the sciences physics biology climate social sciences economics and finance are complex systems in which a large number of components are subject to intricate interactions that change over time The interactions are frequently driven by concurrent deterministic and stochastic processes Sometimes the systems can be modeled starting from fundamental principles that govern them Other times information about the systems comes from empirical observations in the form of large data sets One challenging problem is to understand the behavior in time of such systems and forecast their future evolution
Current projects cover several areas including
 Dynamical systems and applications to celestial mechanics and astrodynamics
 Topological data analysis
 Financial bubbles detection

Current Projects
Stability and Instability in Hamiltonian Systems
Hamiltonian systems represent mathematical models of mechanical systems that conserve total energy In Hamiltonian dynamics stability and instability often coexist For some applications one is interested to ensure the stability of the system while in others one is interested to exploit the instability We are also studying the effect of small dissipation on Hamiltonian systems Applications range from celestial mechanics and space mission design to optimizing the performance of piezoelectric energy harvesting devices
Topological Data Analysis TDA
Topological Data Analysis TDA is a new method to analyze complex multidimensional data via topological tools TDA aims to identifies patterns and features in data not apparent through traditional statistical methods While statistical methods rely on describing data via distribution functions TDA is describing data in terms of the shape of a point cloud Changes of shape reflect subtle shifts in the patterns of the underlying data We are interested in developing applications of TDA to biomedical sciences climate networks and engineering
Financial Bubbles Detection
We are interested in detection of market crashes and financial bubbles In particular we are interested in identifying early warning signals for such extreme events which have practical applications such as minimizing the losses from a bubble crash or maximizing the profit from a rapid rebound In some earlier works we developed a TDAbased methodology for the detection of financial bubbles

The Care is Virtual the Commitment is Real
Read about Dr Michaela Medveds approach to treating patients during the coronavirus pandemic
The Care is Virtual the Commitment is Real
While Dr Michaela Medveds approach to treating patients has been severely affected by the coronavirus her job at its heart hasnt changed She still works in her clinical practice with children and adults to continue focusing on their therapy goals In recent weeks however that has meant communicating with them over video as opposed to treating them at home or in the hospital
Ive been able to maintain a working relationship with my older clients in virtual sessions said Dr Medved a clinical assistant professor in the SpeechLanguage Pathology program at Yeshiva Universitys Katz School of Science and Health But for clients who have feeding or swallowing disorders and underlying medical conditions I havent been able to treat them because its dangerous for them Thats been really tough
A good share of the burden of care said Dr Medved has shifted temporarily to the families of patients But she maintains regular contact guiding caregivers on how to administer treatments to her patients For the past six months she has been working with a 10yearold girl a pediatric stroke victim in her home until the virus prevented her from visiting To make sure though that the girls care continued uninterrupted she gave the parents responsibility albeit under her watchful eye for improving the girls feeding skills
Using FaceTime Dr Medved showed the parents how to use a Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation device which is half the size of a smart phone to administer an intermittent electrical current to their child during a meal The current delivered by two electrodes under the girls chin for half an hour four times a week is meant to strengthen her tongue and swallowing muscles Even with the loss of inperson contact Dr Medved by checking in with the parents regularly has ensured that the girl is making steady progress Shes graduated from eating puree to normal breakfast foods like waffles
We have remained in contact to discuss her progress as well as new foods and textures said Dr Medved but I havent been charging anything because I dont feel comfortable Im sensitive to the fact that these families have more than one child and are overburdened with home schooling
Dr Medved said that though teletherapy is a wonderful alternative in many cases she emphasized that its not a replacement for inperson care for every patient population She has found that teletherapy is most successful when working with older schoolage children adolescents and adults with a variety of diagnoses including expressive and receptive language delays articulation disorders cognitive dysfunction and fluency disorders
Though appropriate at times teletherapy has been increasingly difficult to use with younger childrenbirth to threeolder adults with compromised cognition and patients with feeding and swallowing issues she said
Dr Medved said the current lockdown is teaching her how to be flexible She said healthcare professionals are now beginning to work through online platforms regardless of where their settings once were and though teletherapy will undoubtedly become increasingly popular and more readily used and accessible inperson therapy will always remain the ideal modality for providing therapy services
Since 2016 Dr Medved has been with the Katz School and has taught courses in Clinical SpeechLanguage Pathology Diagnostic Methods Syndromes and Craniofacial Anomalies Communicating with Patients and Families and Stuttering and Related Fluency Disorders
She holds a doctorate in SpeechLanguage Pathology from Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions and a masters degree in SpeechLanguage Pathology and bachelors degree in Speech Pathology and Audiology from Lehman College
The Katz Schools masters program in SpeechLanguage Pathology is one of the few in the country specializing in medical speech pathology taking a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing and treating speech language and communication cases Students graduate prepared to apply for certification from the American SpeechLanguage Hearing Association ASHA and for licensure in New York State
Dr Medved recently published the article  on the website of the Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions
She said she can foresee the important role that the medical speechlanguage pathologist will play in the rehabilitation of individuals globally In order to serve those patients she emphasized that its imperative that students be trained in the most uptodate modalities for intervention evidencebased practice and therapy options
Though we cannot foretell the extent of the needs that will be required we can predict that as patients recover there will be a need for the restoration of swallowing voice motor speech disorders and respiratory deconditioning she said

Developing an Assessment for Diagnosing Autism in Bilingual Children
Helena Goodman a marketing manager at Yeshiva University recently spoke with SLP student May Mahmoud about her experience at the Katz School of Science and Health
May Mahmoud is in her last semester of the Katz Schools SpeechLanguage Pathology program Originally from Alexandria Egypt she currently lives in Brooklyn May is bilingual in Arabic and English and holds an undergraduate degree in speechlanguage pathology from Brooklyn College Helena Goodman a marketing manager at Yeshiva University recently spoke with May about her experience at the Katz School of Science and Health
Q How have you adapted your SLP practice during COVID19
I used to provide services to children and geriatrics in person but I transitioned to teletherapy and distancebased therapy as COVID19 hit It has definitely been an adjustment for my clients as a lot of them have never worked with a pathologist remotely before Yet we have been able to continue to provide help to our clients as the need does not stop Many things have been put on pause during COVID19 however an elderly person recovering from a stroke does not have the luxury to stop his therapy We continue to provide the care that is needed to help our clients in their situations
Q Have you found anything that has made the transition easier
I have found that sometimes you need to compensate for the fact that you are not doing facetoface therapy Certain methods are much harder via Zoom such as playbased therapy  Children with autism cannot sustain eye contact and their attention but as we transitioned I have found ways to supplement this I use the sharedscreen option for book readings and pointing to things This has resulted in many of my clients gaining new skills from remote therapy I believe that even the geriatric population is now learning a bunch of new skills by using these platforms I also see the confidence they are gaining by mastering these platforms
Q What are some of the benefits of the Katz program
The Katz program stood out to me because it was the only one that provided a medical track and an SLP education with an emphasis on working in a medical setting as well as an educational setting Without a medical background you cannot work in a hospital or nursing facility Many dont realize that our field helps more than children but those across the lifespan and with varying abilities The Katz courses are incredibly specialized and specific providing you experience in a variety of topics Marissa Barrera also was a deciding factor We spent over an hour on the phone before I was accepted She was humble and personable It just clickedthe cherry on the top for why I chose Katz
Q What did you focus your research on
My investigation focused on Assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Bilingual Children Standardized assessments are often considered the gold standard for identifying diagnoses This research examined the efficacy of standardized assessments in diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder in bilingual children My longterm goal is to develop a standardized assessment for Arabicspeaking individuals
Q Any advice for prospective students
You have to be passionate  that passion will give you the drive to work hard It is not an easy program but it will prepare you for the real world and work in the field You have to be positive you want to be in the program you are treating people who are in critical condition and you need the skills and patience to give them what they need The ability to help them will come from that passion
After Brain Injury Bilingual Speakers Recovery of Language Varies
Read about Christopher Almontes research on bilingual speakers recoveries
After Brain Injury Bilingual Speakers Recovery of Language Varies
Research by recent SLP graduate concluded that the recovery pattern of expressive and receptive language skills for bilingual speakers can vary after a traumatic brain injury
Recovery can occur in different ways depending on the site of the lesion the severity of the impact the age of the patient and the success of the treatment methods said Christopher Almonte who graduated in May from the Katz School of Science and Health
Receptive language skills have to do with the ability to understand words sentences and the act of speaking while expressive language skills are about producing speech
Children with a receptive language disorder struggle to process speech while engaged in conversation and may rely too much on reading facial expressions Those with an expressive language disorder may rely on simplified messaging strategies that prevent them from translating more complex thoughts into language
The focus of Almontes analysis was on the likelihood of spontaneous language recovery for bilingual EnglishSpanish speakers compared to monolingual speakers as well as which assessment techniques lead to an appropriate diagnosis of aphasia in bilingual speakers
Almonte who immigrated from the Dominican Republic at the age of fifteen originally wanted to be a journalist but decided to become a speechlanguage pathologist after witnessing their work when he was a teacher assistant in the New York City Department of Education He transferred from Bronx Community College where he was working toward an associates degree to Lehman College where he went on to obtain a bachelors degree in speechlanguage pathology
When I saw the work speech pathologists were doing with people with communication language and feeding disorders it was like my heart went right into it said Almonte I wanted to be that person who makes peoples lives better
During his time at the Katz School he was a graduate clinical extern at Kingsbridge Center Riverdale Senior Services and PS X811 all in the Bronx where he facilitated pediatric languageenrichment sessions provided geriatric patients with timely therapeutic services and administered oneonone and group treatment to students between the ages of 14 to 21 with a primary diagnosis of autism emotional disturbance and language impairments
At Ahava Medical in Brooklyn the site of his last externship he provided feeding and swallowing therapy to schoolage children with Agenesis of corpus callosuma rare birth defectbehavioral feeding difficulties and Down Syndrome
After he graduated he was hired as a speechlanguage pathologist by the Bronxbased Important Steps an early childhood program that provides therapeutic and diagnostic services to children with developmental disabilities
In the research analysis capping his Katz School career Almonte cited a study conducted in 1997 by Michel Paradis that identified six different patterns of recovery for bilingual learners parallel selective differential antagonistic successive and blended mix recovery
Parallel recovery takes place when both languages are impaired and recover simultaneously Selective recovery occurs when both languages are capable of being recovered but only one actually does Differential recovery happens when one language returns to normal Antagonistic recovery takes place when one language starts to recover but then regresses once the second language begins recovering Successive recovery occurs when a language starts to recover only after the other language is fully restored And in a blended mix pattern recovery follows no one pattern
Almonte said there isnt enough evidence on how to choose an appropriate assessment battery however its important any assessment for bilingual individuals be sensitive to client experiences He pointed to a study that found that a Spanishspeaking client who lived in Britain and had aphasia struggled to name a hedge since they are unlikely to be found in Spain The clients inability to name the hedge decreased the clients score in an aphasia battery

The Katz program stood out to me because it was the only one that provided a medical track and an SLP education with an emphasis on working in a medical setting as well as an educational setting Without a medical background you cannot work in a hospital or nursing facility Many dont realize that our field helps more than children but those across the lifespan and with varying abilities The Katz courses are incredibly specialized and specific providing you experience in a variety of topics Marissa Barrera also was a deciding factor We spent over an hour on the phone before I was accepted She was humble and personable It just clickedthe cherry on the top for why I chose Katz
Q What did you focus your research on
My investigation focused on Assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Bilingual Children Standardized assessments are often considered the gold standard for identifying diagnoses This research examined the efficacy of standardized assessments in diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder in bilingual children My longterm goal is to develop a standardized assessment for Arabicspeaking individuals
Q Any advice for prospective students
You have to be passionate  that passion will give you the drive to work hard It is not an easy program but it will prepare you for the real world and work in the field You have to be positive you want to be in the program you are treating people who are in critical condition and you need the skills and patience to give them what they need The ability to help them will come from that passion
After Brain Injury Bilingual Speakers Recovery of Language Varies
Read about Christopher Almontes research on bilingual speakers recoveries
After Brain Injury Bilingual Speakers Recovery of Language Varies
Research by recent SLP graduate concluded that the recovery pattern of expressive and receptive language skills for bilingual speakers can vary after a traumatic brain injury
Recovery can occur in different ways depending on the site of the lesion the severity of the impact the age of the patient and the success of the treatment methods said Christopher Almonte who graduated in May from the Katz School of Science and Health
Receptive language skills have to do with the ability to understand words sentences and the act of speaking while expressive language skills are about producing speech
Children with a receptive language disorder struggle to process speech while engaged in conversation and may rely too much on reading facial expressions Those with an expressive language disorder may rely on simplified messaging strategies that prevent them from translating more complex thoughts into language
The focus of Almontes analysis was on the likelihood of spontaneous language recovery for bilingual EnglishSpanish speakers compared to monolingual speakers as well as which assessment techniques lead to an appropriate diagnosis of aphasia in bilingual speakers
Almonte who immigrated from the Dominican Republic at the age of fifteen originally wanted to be a journalist but decided to become a speechlanguage pathologist after witnessing their work when he was a teacher assistant in the New York City Department of Education He transferred from Bronx Community College where he was working toward an associates degree to Lehman College where he went on to obtain a bachelors degree in speechlanguage pathology
When I saw the work speech pathologists were doing with people with communication language and feeding disorders it was like my heart went right into it said Almonte I wanted to be that person who makes peoples lives better
During his time at the Katz School he was a graduate clinical extern at Kingsbridge Center Riverdale Senior Services and PS X811 all in the Bronx where he facilitated pediatric languageenrichment sessions provided geriatric patients with timely therapeutic services and administered oneonone and group treatment to students between the ages of 14 to 21 with a primary diagnosis of autism emotional disturbance and language impairments
At Ahava Medical in Brooklyn the site of his last externship he provided feeding and swallowing therapy to schoolage children with Agenesis of corpus callosuma rare birth defectbehavioral feeding difficulties and Down Syndrome
After he graduated he was hired as a speechlanguage pathologist by the Bronxbased Important Steps an early childhood program that provides therapeutic and diagnostic services to children with developmental disabilities
In the research analysis capping his Katz School career Almonte cited a study conducted in 1997 by Michel Paradis that identified six different patterns of recovery for bilingual learners parallel selective differential antagonistic successive and blended mix recovery
Parallel recovery takes place when both languages are impaired and recover simultaneously Selective recovery occurs when both languages are capable of being recovered but only one actually does Differential recovery happens when one language returns to normal Antagonistic recovery takes place when one language starts to recover but then regresses once the second language begins recovering Successive recovery occurs when a language starts to recover only after the other language is fully restored And in a blended mix pattern recovery follows no one pattern
Almonte said there isnt enough evidence on how to choose an appropriate assessment battery however its important any assessment for bilingual individuals be sensitive to client experiences He pointed to a study that found that a Spanishspeaking client who lived in Britain and had aphasia struggled to name a hedge since they are unlikely to be found in Spain The clients inability to name the hedge decreased the clients score in an aphasia battery

Numerical Explorations in the NonLinear Schrodinger Equation
Authors Yonah Moise and Yedidya Moise BAMA in Mathematics
Faculty Advisor Jeremy Schiff PhD BarIlan University
Abstract The Nonlinear Schrodinger equation is a partial differential equation PDE whose principal application is to the propagation of a beam of light Saturated nonlinearity acts as a limitation on the nonlinear component of the equation to prevent it from blowing up After reproducing initial conditions from Gatz and Herrmann 1997 which are based on certain constraints the splitstep method was applied to step forward in time and approximate the solution to this PDE for any given time We then constructed a Gaussian function of two dimensions with a power equivalent to the power of the solution and ran the splitstep method on this function to study it as an approximation of the solution The observed two internal modes in the behavior of the widths as well as other observed behavior provide a basis for analysis of this approximate solution

Magnetic Permeability Measurements in MRI
Author Yonathan Magendzo BAMA in Physics
Faculty Advisor Fredy Zypman PhD
Abstract Detection of traces of iron in the brain is useful for medical applications Different tissues possessing different magnetic permeabilities expose themselves via small spatial variations of the magnetic field during magnetic resonance imaging MRI Data acquisition and image analysis methods that visualize spatial distributions of magnetic permeabilities are known as quantitative permeability mapping The permeabilities are found through local distortions in all components of the magnetic field However most modern techniques of MRI model the brain as a collection of magnetic dipoles and therefore only the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is assessable to MRI An MRI machine doesnt have enough information to map the permeabilities To address this problem we developed an algorithm that can map the permeabilities only needing the longitudinal component of the magnetic field

Addressing Emotional Regulation Through Interoception for Clinicians and Parents
Author Arielle Nyenty Occupational Therapy Doctorate
Faculty Advisor Alexandra Wagner PhD OTRL
Abstract Interoception which describes the concept of feeling grasping and understanding ones internal bodily sensations plays a vital role in defining emotional regulation ER in early childhood and throughout life Current research considers interoception a foundational component of effective ER which was a concern for parents at My Kids Therapy an occupational therapy sensory gym for children The purpose of this project was to provide an alternative evidencebased method for occupational therapists at My Kids Therapy to assess and address ER in children ages 4 to 6 through measuring and developing their interoception Outcomes included the development of an interoception accuracy IA screening tool for clinicians to use with their clients resources for parents and caregivers to address IA and ER in their homes and a bodyemotion diagram visually demonstrating the effect of interoception on ER to be used by clinicians parents and families
 When you train a child to count their own heartbeat they learn to listen to other senses in their bodywhich ultimately regulates their emotions

Forgive but Dont Forget Lessons Learned from the Paycheck Protection Program
Author Avi Skidelsky MS in Data Analytics and Visualization
Faculty Advisors Andrew Catlin and James Topor MS
Abstract The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program PPP to assist small businesses affected by the COVID19 pandemic At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1 interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years At the time of writing the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85 of applicants totaling over 100 billion Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request using sampling techniques and machine learning methods Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process Instead the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness
 Looking back on this and other government assisted programs theyre taking trillions of dollars in hits but when the program was rolled out they were doing it for the sake of helping people

 We could take this program and use it as a blueprint for when future bailouts need to happen

NavierStokes Numerical Simulation of Vortices in the Compressible Gas Flow
Author Ellie Austin PhD in Mathematical Sciences
Faculty Advisor Antonella Marini PhD
Abstract Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the CouetteTaylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the NavierStokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature With increasing Reynolds number values the vortex density increased reaching a certain level then sharply decreased A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature
 I researched the applications of NavierStokes formulas specifically tailored to compressible gas flow which has implications for when engineers build things like aircrafts or steam turbines

 Its at the intersection of both math and engineering

Play and ArtsBased Program for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
Author Harlee Feldman Occupational Therapy Doctorate
Faculty Advisor Alexandra Wagner PhD OTRL
Abstract Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers Additionally art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity socialemotional language and cognitive skills Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ASD because it works with the strengths of this population such as attention to detail while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population such as cognitive flexibility The project included the development of a play and artsbased program with the goal of increasing the selfesteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high selfesteem and good social skills
 There are so many types of interventions that have worked with this population but no one has tried to incorporate all those practices into one curriculum

 I was curious If I made something more engaging something they would find fun and exciting would that change the way they react

Identifying the Gap Clients DeniedDelayed Early Intervention Speech and Language Services Due to New CDC Milestones
Author Jillian Rossi MS in SpeechLanguage Pathology
Faculty Advisors Marissa Barrera PhD CCCSLP Michaela Medved PhD CCCSLP Amiya WaldmanLevi PhD OTRL
Abstract In 2022 the Centers for Disease Control changed the developmental milestones for children from birth to 3 years old it was the first change in over two decades The modification included delaying selected speech and language milestones by six months This decision yields a range of ramifications for young children and their families The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of children whose qualification for early intervention EI speech and language services will be delayed or denied as a result of the new guidelines and the length of time children would be delayed receiving EI speech and language services in order to identify contributing risk factors for communication disorders and overall development The study involved a survey of 63 speechlanguage pathologists who were asked to consider EI clients who just missed or met their milestones The survey revealed that 49 of clients qualified for services later than they would have with the older developmental milestones This study concluded that the new developmental milestones resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for clients

A Multifaceted Interactive Child Development Toolkit for Jewish Parents
Author Miriam Graham Occupational Therapy Doctorate
Faculty Advisor Mindy Garfinkel OTD OTRL
Abstract Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a childs development and therefore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC urges parents to monitor developmental milestones However the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities including the ultraOrthodox Jewish community due to their insular culture An innovative andragogybased method to educate young ultraOrthodox Jewish mothers who spend significant time caring for their children about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial The purpose of this project is to create a childrens book which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones This dualnarration style is an effective way to educate parents since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their cooccupation of spending time with their children

Does Increased Technology Use by Parents and Caregivers Impact the Social Language Skills of Developing Children
Author Molly Hampton MS in SpeechLanguage Pathology
Faculty Advisor Troy Dargin PhD CCCSLP
Abstract Over the last decade technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parentcaretaker behavior have on childrens language skills and behavior as well as the impact of increased technology use on childrens development in these areas The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness This in turn could negatively impact the childs social language skills More indepth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on childrens developmental skills
 There are a bunch of guidelines on how much screen time children should use However Im hoping this research gives parents a guideline for their own technology usebecause parents screen time really does affect their children

Modeling Complex Hand Grasps Using Muscle Activity of Movement Primitives
Author Natania Birnbaum MS in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship
Faculty Advisor Sai Praveen Kadiyala PhD
Abstract Motor function of the hands is often lost as the result of a stroke and is difficult to restore which has a detrimental effect on stroke survivors ability to perform everyday tasks Many methods exist to assist survivors in rehabilitation but those based on surface electromyography sEMG hold promise due to their flexibility of placement ease of data collection and patient comfort and costeffectiveness and increased patient motivation A myoelectric exoskeleton controlled by sEMG sensors on the muscles of a patients arm can be used in upperlimb rehabilitation therapy In this work we aim to model complex grasps belonging to activities of daily living ADL using simple movement primitives of upper arm and validate on a lowcost test bed We collected sEMG data of five movement primitives and tried to model 10 grasps which are a part of ADL A multiple linear regression applied on grasp and movement primitive data showed that some of the primitives had more of an impact on the model than others and that the gestures had an inconsistent effect on the model across multiple trials Replication of both movement primitives and complex grasps on our test bed was conducted successfully

Abstract A Hamiltonian system is a mathematical model for mechanical systems obeying the law of conservation of energy When a perturbation is added to the system the energy is not necessarily conserved for instance it may evolve randomly or even decay We are interested in systems for which despite the perturbation we can obtain energy growth Specifically we consider a pendulumrotator system coupled with a small timeperiodic Hamiltonian perturbation and with an additional damping perturbation For this system we prove the existence of diffusing orbits where the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter This work extends the celebrated Arnold diffusion conjecture to the case of Hamiltonian systems with small dissipation

Abstract In a considerable majority of male infertility cases the underlying component has not been discovered SUMOylation posttranslational modification by small ubiquitinlike modifiers or SUMO proteins has emerged as a crucial regulating event in several developmental processes including reproduction Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SUMOylation arrests meiosis and affects expression and phosphorylation of several proteins In order to confirm some of the identified targets and better comprehend the mechanisms regulated by SUMO in germ cells SUMOylation cycle was downregulated using inhibitors like Ginkgolic acid GA and small interfering RNA siRNA technology The effect of the inhibition on the expression level and phosphorylation status of several proteins regulating meiosis and spermatogenesis like Nucleophosmin NPM heterogenous ribonucleoprotein H1 hnRNPH1 and Valosine containing protein VCP were studied using gel electrophoresis and western blotting Results confirmed the downregulation of these proteins upon inhibition of SUMOylation suggesting the importance of their regulation during spermatogenesis This finding underscores the significance of characterizing new proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate spermatogenesis

Abstract The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program PPP to assist small businesses affected by the COVID19 pandemic At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1 interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years At the time of writing the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85 of applicants totaling over 100 billion Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request using sampling techniques and machine learning methods Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process Instead the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness
 Looking back on this and other government assisted programs theyre taking trillions of dollars in hits but when the program was rolled out they were doing it for the sake of helping people

 We could take this program and use it as a blueprint for when future bailouts need to happen

Abstract Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the CouetteTaylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the NavierStokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature With increasing Reynolds number values the vortex density increased reaching a certain level then sharply decreased A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature
 I researched the applications of NavierStokes formulas specifically tailored to compressible gas flow which has implications for when engineers build things like aircrafts or steam turbines

 Its at the intersection of both math and engineering

Faculty Advisor Alexandra Wagner PhD OTRL
Abstract Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers Additionally art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity socialemotional language and cognitive skills Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ASD because it works with the strengths of this population such as attention to detail while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population such as cognitive flexibility The project included the development of a play and artsbased program with the goal of increasing the selfesteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high selfesteem and good social skills
 There are so many types of interventions that have worked with this population but no one has tried to incorporate all those practices into one curriculum

 I was curious If I made something more engaging something they would find fun and exciting would that change the way they react

Abstract Reflective functioning RF is the ability of a parent to understand and be more aware of their own internal mental state thoughts and reasoning It is unclear if RF influences joint play between fathers and sons so the purpose of the study was to examine if fathers with higher RF are more supportive in their play with their sons compared to fathers who have both a lower RF and a higher endorsement of traditional masculine ideology Twenty Englishspeaking predominately married Caucasian fathers of typically developing sons ages 3 to 9 were recruited for the study Videos of 15minute jointplay sessions recorded at home were analyzed using the Parent Support of Child Playfulness Scale Surveys were given using the Male Role Norms InventoryRevised scale and the RuminationReflection Questionnaire An analysis revealed a significant correlation between a fathers higher RF and a lower view of traditional masculinity ideology and vice versa Results also indicated no significant correlation between the fathers RF and support provided to his son during joint play

Abstract Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a childs development and therefore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC urges parents to monitor developmental milestones However the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities including the ultraOrthodox Jewish community due to their insular culture An innovative andragogybased method to educate young ultraOrthodox Jewish mothers who spend significant time caring for their children about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial The purpose of this project is to create a childrens book which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones This dualnarration style is an effective way to educate parents since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their cooccupation of spending time with their children

Abstract Over the last decade technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parentcaretaker behavior have on childrens language skills and behavior as well as the impact of increased technology use on childrens development in these areas The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness This in turn could negatively impact the childs social language skills More indepth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on childrens developmental skills
 There are a bunch of guidelines on how much screen time children should use However Im hoping this research gives parents a guideline for their own technology usebecause parents screen time really does affect their children

Abstract Detection of traces of iron in the brain is useful for medical applications Different tissues possessing different magnetic permeabilities expose themselves via small spatial variations of the magnetic field during magnetic resonance imaging MRI Data acquisition and image analysis methods that visualize spatial distributions of magnetic permeabilities are known as quantitative permeability mapping The permeabilities are found through local distortions in all components of the magnetic field However most modern techniques of MRI model the brain as a collection of magnetic dipoles and therefore only the longitudinal component of the magnetic field is assessable to MRI An MRI machine doesnt have enough information to map the permeabilities To address this problem we developed an algorithm that can map the permeabilities only needing the longitudinal component of the magnetic field

Faculty Advisors Andrew Catlin and James Topor MS
Abstract The United States Small Business Association launched the Paycheck Protection Program PPP to assist small businesses affected by the COVID19 pandemic At a time where major retailers and corporations were able to flourish due to their online infrastructure many small businesses suffered under quarantine rules The PPP was intended to assist small businesses and preserve jobs by giving loans at a 1 interest rate and a maturity of either two or five years At the time of writing the SBA has granted forgiveness to 85 of applicants totaling over 100 billion Focusing on two major deficiencies in the program the high forgiveness amount and the high levels of fraud this project sought to answer whether there is a way to predict the amount of forgiveness that a borrower will request using sampling techniques and machine learning methods Results show no direct correlation between the variables and the amount of loan forgiveness applied for to be able to put together a prediction process Instead the findings suggest that regulatory agencies like the SBA need to tighten their lending requirements and the federal government needs to apply more oversight to certain lending bodies in order to prevent fraud and decrease forgiveness
 Looking back on this and other government assisted programs theyre taking trillions of dollars in hits but when the program was rolled out they were doing it for the sake of helping people

 We could take this program and use it as a blueprint for when future bailouts need to happen

NavierStokes Numerical Simulation of Vortices in the Compressible Gas Flow
Author Ellie Austin PhD in Mathematical Sciences
Faculty Advisor Antonella Marini PhD
Abstract Compressible gas flow is of great importance for both theoretical and applied science The aim of this study was to develop numerical modeling of the vortex structure of the CouetteTaylor flow for a compressible gas flow in a wind tunnel that depends on Reynolds numbers and cylinder surface temperatures applying the NavierStokes equations and using ANSYS CFX software package The density of vortices and their structure depends on the Reynolds number and surface temperature cylinders The Reynolds number is based on the speed of the inner cylinder and the temperature is referred to as stagnation temperature Calculations showed a similar dependence of the vortex density on the Reynolds number and surface temperature With increasing Reynolds number values the vortex density increased reaching a certain level then sharply decreased A similar picture was observed for the ratio of the density of vortices and temperature
 I researched the applications of NavierStokes formulas specifically tailored to compressible gas flow which has implications for when engineers build things like aircrafts or steam turbines

 Its at the intersection of both math and engineering

Play and ArtsBased Program for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
Author Harlee Feldman Occupational Therapy Doctorate
Faculty Advisor Alexandra Wagner PhD OTRL
Abstract Play is a primary occupation of children ages 7 to 9 as they explore the world and themselves and gain the necessary skills to engage with peers Additionally art is frequently used in the school and home setting for these children because it supports the development of creativity socialemotional language and cognitive skills Art is especially used for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ASD because it works with the strengths of this population such as attention to detail while helping to increase skills that are difficult for this population such as cognitive flexibility The project included the development of a play and artsbased program with the goal of increasing the selfesteem and social skills of children ages 7 to 9 with a diagnosis of ASD Participating in a program that uses play and art mediums can help children in this age group with a diagnosis of autism spectrum attain the tools required to maintain high selfesteem and good social skills
 There are so many types of interventions that have worked with this population but no one has tried to incorporate all those practices into one curriculum

 I was curious If I made something more engaging something they would find fun and exciting would that change the way they react

Abstract Early detection of developmental delay is crucial for a childs development and therefore the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC urges parents to monitor developmental milestones However the resources available are inaccessible for certain communities including the ultraOrthodox Jewish community due to their insular culture An innovative andragogybased method to educate young ultraOrthodox Jewish mothers who spend significant time caring for their children about the CDC developmental milestones is crucial The purpose of this project is to create a childrens book which contains a primary story for children and a secondary narration with information and strategies for parents to support their child in achieving developmental milestones This dualnarration style is an effective way to educate parents since it informs them about the CDC milestones and the strategies to achieve them during their cooccupation of spending time with their children

Does Increased Technology Use by Parents and Caregivers Impact the Social Language Skills of Developing Children
Author Molly Hampton MS in SpeechLanguage Pathology
Faculty Advisor Troy Dargin PhD CCCSLP
Abstract Over the last decade technology use and average screen time have been increasing among children and adults all over the world This literature review examined the impact of increased technology use and screen time on the part of caregivers and parents through things like cell phones and tablets on the developing language skills and behavior of children ages 6 months to 8 years old The methods involved examining numerous studies that evaluated the impacts of parentcaretaker behavior have on childrens language skills and behavior as well as the impact of increased technology use on childrens development in these areas The reviewed literature indicates that parental smartphone use may be associated with changes in parental sensitivity and responsiveness This in turn could negatively impact the childs social language skills More indepth research is needed to fully understand the effect that technology has on childrens developmental skills
 There are a bunch of guidelines on how much screen time children should use However Im hoping this research gives parents a guideline for their own technology usebecause parents screen time really does affect their children

Brief Expository on Arnold Diffusion in Dissipative Systems
Author Samuel W Akingbade PhD in Mathematical Sciences

Abstract A Hamiltonian system is a mathematical model for mechanical systems obeying the law of conservation of energy When a perturbation is added to the system the energy is not necessarily conserved for instance it may evolve randomly or even decay We are interested in systems for which despite the perturbation we can obtain energy growth Specifically we consider a pendulumrotator system coupled with a small timeperiodic Hamiltonian perturbation and with an additional damping perturbation For this system we prove the existence of diffusing orbits where the energy of the rotator grows by an amount independent of the size of the coupling parameter for all sufficiently small values of the coupling parameter This work extends the celebrated Arnold diffusion conjecture to the case of Hamiltonian systems with small dissipation

Characterization of Targets Regulated by SUMOylation in Mouse Spermatocytes
Authors Sayanto Pal and Shaye Weinstein MS in Biotechnology Management and Entrepreneurship Margarita Vigodner PhD Stern College for Women Yeshiva University
Abstract In a considerable majority of male infertility cases the underlying component has not been discovered SUMOylation posttranslational modification by small ubiquitinlike modifiers or SUMO proteins has emerged as a crucial regulating event in several developmental processes including reproduction Previous studies have shown that inhibition of SUMOylation arrests meiosis and affects expression and phosphorylation of several proteins In order to confirm some of the identified targets and better comprehend the mechanisms regulated by SUMO in germ cells SUMOylation cycle was downregulated using inhibitors like Ginkgolic acid GA and small interfering RNA siRNA technology The effect of the inhibition on the expression level and phosphorylation status of several proteins regulating meiosis and spermatogenesis like Nucleophosmin NPM heterogenous ribonucleoprotein H1 hnRNPH1 and Valosine containing protein VCP were studied using gel electrophoresis and western blotting Results confirmed the downregulation of these proteins upon inhibition of SUMOylation suggesting the importance of their regulation during spermatogenesis This finding underscores the significance of characterizing new proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate spermatogenesis

Investigating Brain Injury in Domestic Violence Survivors and Individuals with Substance Misuse
Author Sheila Vousoghian Occupational Therapy Doctorate
Faculty Advisor Alexandra Wagner PhD OTRL
Abstract While there is ample research on the physical and psychological impacts of traumatic brain injuries and on the benefits of early identification and intervention in preventing lifelong complications from them there is a lack of awareness of traumatic brain injury among domestic violence survivors and individuals with substance misuse As a result individuals who face domestic violence and substance misuse may not know they have or are not diagnosed with TBI leading to diminished health outcomes With the goal of increasing awareness this project involved creating a full set of course materials that will be used as part of an online certification course to train domestic violence organizations on screening for traumatic brain injury and creating and distributing a fact sheet on substance misuse and traumatic brain injury with the goal of early intervention These interventions will increase awareness as substance misuse and domestic violence facilities become more familiar with the signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury

Abstract The Nonlinear Schrodinger equation is a partial differential equation PDE whose principal application is to the propagation of a beam of light Saturated nonlinearity acts as a limitation on the nonlinear component of the equation to prevent it from blowing up After reproducing initial conditions from Gatz and Herrmann 1997 which are based on certain constraints the splitstep method was applied to step forward in time and approximate the solution to this PDE for any given time We then constructed a Gaussian function of two dimensions with a power equivalent to the power of the solution and ran the splitstep method on this function to study it as an approximation of the solution The observed two internal modes in the behavior of the widths as well as other observed behavior provide a basis for analysis of this approximate solution

Loretta Chingandu
From Zambia to the UN
For as long as I can remember I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something where young girls can dream without limits where voices from the margins are heard at the center and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is
But life has also taught me that belief alone isnt enough It takes action It takes showing up even when youre unsure It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there
From my early advocacy years I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa CYLA When Females Lead and Girls Gone Political These organizations pushed me refined me and prepared me for bigger moments to come They taught me that no seat at the table is too big no stage too grand and no issue too complex for young people to lead on
On February 5 2025 I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters leading a highlevel session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5 Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth MGCY Gender Youth Caucus I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time
The company was both humbling and inspiring I was privileged to be joined by HE Ambassador AlWasil  Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women Shawyn PattersonHoward  Mayor of Mount Vernon New York Aarushi Khanna  AsiaPacific Regional Lead Equal Measures 2030 Foteini Papagioti  Deputy Director of Policy  Advocacy International Center for Research on Women ICRW Olela Tonny  Gender Expert Child Protection  SRHR Advocate and Diene Keita  Deputy Executive Director of Programme UNFPA
The conversation was urgent necessary and deeply personal We discussed barriers women and girls still face the financing gaps for gender equality and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact And how the world cannot afford to sideline womens voices expertise and leadership any longer because when women lead communities thrive economies grow and societies become more just
In my years of advocacy Ive also learned that sometimes proximity is everything Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard
A year ago I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open Today I find myself leading conversations that shape the future
But this is not just my story It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream It is the story of every young advocate every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work to the learning to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens
This is why I do what I do

Runway Dreams
From Social Media Influencing to NY Fashion Week
Hello everyone Im thrilled to introduce myself Im a digital marketing and media student who recently moved to the vibrant city of New York from Jharkhand India The energy here is palpable and every corner seems to hold a new adventure From the iconic skyline to the endless cultural experiences I am constantly inspired by everything NYC has to offer
My adventure in social media began seven years ago when I decided to share my passion with the world Starting with just 1000 followers I posted about my love for lifestyle travel beauty and fashion I remember feeling a rush every time someone liked or commented on my posts
It was a slow climb but I was determined to grow my community Through trial and error I learned the ins and outs of social media all on my own I spent countless hours researching trends experimenting with different types of content and engaging with my followers I embraced my authenticity sharing my unique story and it paid offI eventually grew my Instagram follower count missfashioncupid to over 100000
Once I arrived in NYC that growth had no limit Just a highlight I got the incredible opportunity to go to New York Fashion Week 2024 as a Creator Guest for Runway 7 and to walk as a model for the brand ELJ Avenue and the Indian brand KHOOB at NYFW
Reflecting on my social media journey Ive learned some valuable lessons Here are my top three secrets to becoming an influencer
 Authenticity is Key People crave real stories When I started sharing my true self my audience began to connect with me on a deeper level
Consistency Matters I learned that posting regularly is crucial By staying engaged with my followers I built trust and loyalty turning casual viewers into a supportive community
Master the Tools Familiarizing myself with various platforms and analytical tools helped me understand what worked best for my audience guiding my growth
The Power of Networking
One of the most significant lessons Ive learned is the power of networking Every connection Ive made has opened new doorswhether for collaborations friendships or mentorships Ive made it a priority to attend workshops social gatherings school and academic events and NYC happenings like popups brand parties launches and store invitations These events have enriched my experience and allowed me to meet inspiring individuals who motivate me to grow These events have also deepened my understanding of the marketing culture in the US and helped me network and connect with more people and brands
Sometimes it can be tiring to attend all these events but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward I realize this is something I cant afford to tire of its too important for my growth and journey
For new students like me the fastpaced NYC environment can be a bit overwhelming Here are a few tricks to help you stay connected and involved
Follow Local Influencers They often share events and hidden gems that might otherwise slip under the radar Their insights are invaluable
Use Event Apps Platforms like Eventbrite and Meetup are my goto for finding local happenings and networking opportunities I also recommend secret nyc and nycbucketlist
Join University Groups Follow schools newsletter to stay updated with whats happening in and around the campus and the city And keep an eye on the schools and clubs social media pages which often highlight events around campus and in the city making it easier to get involved
Looking Ahead
As my graduate studies in this vibrant city come to an end I find myself dreaming about the future Im passionate about social media marketing and see it as a perfect blend of creativity and strategy I envision myself working with brands that align with my values helping them elevate their online presence
The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies analyze consumer behavior and apply datadriven insightsall of which Ive started integrating into my influencer work These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goalscreating winwin partnerships
As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me the professors the classmates the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey The path ahead is full of potential and Im excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing
For those just starting their journey remember to embrace your authenticity keep learning and harness the power of networking Lets make the most of this incredible city together chasing dreams and creating connections along the way Heres to new adventures

Global Citizen
From the bustling streets of Harare Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery Growing up in Zimbabwe a country rich in culture and resilience I embarked on a career in banking starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact My story is also one of adaptation and growth from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change
Today I am immersed in the world of digital marketing and media at Katz School of Science and Health My inspiration to pursue my masters in digital media came from observing my former employers transformation into a digital bank in Zimbabwe Witnessing this evolution ignited my curiosity about how digital innovations can reshape industries globally
Choosing the Katz School was a natural fit for me Its diverse culture which I discovered while browsing the schools website and its prime location in the heart of New York Citya place Ive always dreamed of livingmade it feel surreal
In addition to my studies I serve as a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing where I guide international students in choosing their programs and schools helping them secure funding for their education By combining my financial sector experience with my growing knowledge in digital marketing and media I aim to offer invaluable support to students navigating their academic journeys
My favorite class is Consumer Behavior Coming from a finance background I lacked knowledge about utilizing consumer behavior in developing marketing strategies This class has been enlightening and our professor Sivia Naimer is incredibly engaging friendly and caring making the learning experience even more enjoyable
My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to mefreedom opportunity and a rich diverse history Coming from Harare I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings
On the other hand Central Park feels like home Its my goto place to escape the hustle and bustle unwind and enjoy some peace and tranquility Theres something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the citys energy in a way thats comforting and familiar
My advice for incoming students is to embrace the rich tapestry of cultural diversity youll encounterits one of the greatest assets youll experience Stay ahead academically by being proactive and disciplined in your studies ensuring you build a solid foundation for your future Managing your finances wisely is crucial develop a budget and stick to it to avoid unnecessary stress Surround yourself with a strong support network of friends mentors and advisors who will uplift and guide you Prioritize your physical and mental health as they are vital to your overall success and wellbeing Take the time to explore and enjoy your new environment as it will broaden your horizons and enrich your experience Lastly maintain a positive and resilient attitude turning challenges into opportunities for growth and development With these principles youll not only survive but thrive in this new chapter of your life
Embarking on the journey to America is both exciting and challenging As someone who has made this journey I would like to share some tips to help you prepare and succeed
 Research and Plan Ahead Familiarize yourself with the visa process university requirements and the city youll be living in Proper planning will help you avoid lastminute surprises
 Cultural Adaptation Embrace the cultural diversity and be open to learning Engage with different cultures to enrich your experience and broaden your perspective
 Academic Preparedness Stay ahead in your studies by understanding the academic expectations and resources available Make use of study groups tutoring services and office hours to excel in your coursework
 Financial Management Budget wisely Understand the cost of living in your new city and manage your finances to avoid unnecessary stress Look for parttime job opportunities that align with your visa regulations As a brand ambassador at MPOWER Financing I can assist you with financial advice and resources tailored to international students
 Build a Support Network Connect with fellow students join international student organizations and participate in campus activities Having a support network will make your transition smoother and your experience more enjoyable
 Stay Healthy Take care of your physical and mental health Utilize university health services and maintain a balanced lifestyle to ensure you can perform your best academically and socially

Discovering the Magic of Central Park
I used to live in Siberia where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bonechilling 36 degrees below zero Amid those harsh conditions I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park which I kept as my desktop screensaver This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold and it kindled a dream within me I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize
Last year I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality Central Park once a distant daydream now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams
Every Sunday I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty enjoy a picnic and soak up the atmosphere Central Park to me has become more than just a scenic escape its a testament to the power of belief It proves that dreams no matter how big or seemingly impossible can come true for those who refuse to give up
Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park
   Its a wideopen field with a view of skyscrapers perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends
  This historic structure is one of the first built in the park I love walking here admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians Fun fact you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2
   I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my onceimpossible dream had come true
   One of the most iconic features of Central Park this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake
   Also known as Central Park Reservoir it covers a significant portion of the parks surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline
Central Park isnt just a fairweather friend It boasts yearround attractions cherry blossoms in the spring between 72nd and 96th streets iceskating rinks in winter and biking in the summer
To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and indeed New York City theres no better way than strolling its paths On foot you can discover your own personal power place a spot that will pull you back time and time again For me that power spot is Central Park It isnt just a destination its an embodiment of dreams an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers wherever we are from

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School The curriculum integrates realworld projects providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure From the very beginning I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career
Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship and Dr Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions respectively Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty
In addition to my studies Im a research assistant under Dr Margarita Vigodner professor of biology at YUs Stern College for Women studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells In her lab we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation This helps us to validate some of the identified targets which play an important role in spermatogenesis as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells We used gelelectrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr Vigodner but Ive also profited just from working beside an experienced and wellrespected researcher
Outside the lab I serve as vice president of the  In this role Im able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture Last fall the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students strengthening their networks and increasing the size of their social circle These events provided a muchneeded opportunity for students to unwind and destress
Personally one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York Citys rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions So far Ive visited Times Square the Brooklyn Bridge Central Park and St Patricks Cathedral and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate
My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn and you will be amazed at the doors that will open
My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of lifechanging After I graduate next year I plan to become a lifesciences consultant assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products I hadnt considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills experiences and relationships Ive gained at the Katz School

NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home I feel at home at the Katz School because of the kind and supportive atmosphere it offers If you ever need somebody to cheer you on or join in on an activity your professors and friends are always there Most notably Dr Khan Dr Vigodner and Dr Natasha were there for me through thick and thin Whenever there has been a storm Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter much like an umbrella

Best NYC Study Spots
Even in New York Citys bustling environment you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience exploring the citys arts music architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration
Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the citys diverse offerings Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study
One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the NepaliAmerican community With 500 of my countrymen looking on NYCs Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eightfoottall Nepali flag in Manhattans Bowling Green Park in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center
New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York Citys South Asian communities It was quite a moment because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud
I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva Universitys reputation for educational excellence the abundance of economic opportunity and because its home to 70000 Nepalese immigrants
Here are my favorite study spots in New York City
1 476 5th Ave at 42nd Street  My top pick for inspiring study spaces New York Citys flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions
2 in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets  If studying outdoors is your thing be sure to check out this 15acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park

Parisian Flair meets New York Hustle
Im Diane Schrenzel originally from Paris France now pursuing my MS in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva Universitys Katz School of Science and Health in NYC Alongside my studies I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm crafting strategies for success
My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major another passion of mine
Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID19 pandemic I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years This role solidified my interest in business and marketing prompting me to pursue my masters degree at the Katz School of Science and Health
New York Citys vibrant atmosphere and cultural richness have always drawn me in reminiscent of the energy I love about Paris The bustling cityscape combined with Katz Schools diverse student body and esteemed faculty made it an easy choice for me

Chinese New Year Celebration 2024 Year of the Dragon
By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao
The ChineseJewish Conversation CJC and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus Yagoda Commons  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions music games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine For Yining Zhang a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad He noted that it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the worldand to learn about the Jewish New Year
For Chinese students far from home the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community Known also as the Spring Festival the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture Culminating in the Lantern Festival it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two
Ms Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr Mordechai Cohen the Director of the CJC Dr Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare He explained that the Jewish New Year Rosh haShanah is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar In contrast the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice Interestingly this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevatspecifically the New Year for Trees a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon or Tu BiShevat the 15th of Shevat which coincides with Chinas Lantern Festival Dr Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year as they did in 2023 and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year
After the lecture an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience with prizes awarded to the winners Some of the Chinese participants including Ms He were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture
No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song and the evening was no exception with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics The audience was particularly moved when Dr Cohen accompanied by his son Elisha YUHSB 24 performed a beloved traditional Chinese song The Moon Represents My Heart The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures Elisha who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir also shared Hebrew songs adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening
The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games including lucky draw and a chopsticks pingpong ball competition With the latter the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students The winners received traditional Red Packets with a gift card
The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended  For Stern College student Breindy Berger the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful  I found the quiz fascinating and the pingpong game a lot of fun Chaya Goldberger her classmate added I learned how to say Happy New Year in Chinese from my new friend Xinyue Huang It was such a fantastic event Wei Luo a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration It allowed us Chinese students studying abroad to feel the festivals warmth and blessings

From Zambia to the UN
For as long as I can remember I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something where young girls can dream without limits where voices from the margins are heard at the center and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is
But life has also taught me that belief alone isnt enough It takes action It takes showing up even when youre unsure It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there
From my early advocacy years I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa CYLA When Females Lead and Girls Gone Political These organizations pushed me refined me and prepared me for bigger moments to come They taught me that no seat at the table is too big no stage too grand and no issue too complex for young people to lead on
On February 5 2025 I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters leading a highlevel session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5 Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth MGCY Gender Youth Caucus I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time
The company was both humbling and inspiring I was privileged to be joined by HE Ambassador AlWasil  Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women Shawyn PattersonHoward  Mayor of Mount Vernon New York Aarushi Khanna  AsiaPacific Regional Lead Equal Measures 2030 Foteini Papagioti  Deputy Director of Policy  Advocacy International Center for Research on Women ICRW Olela Tonny  Gender Expert Child Protection  SRHR Advocate and Diene Keita  Deputy Executive Director of Programme UNFPA
The conversation was urgent necessary and deeply personal We discussed barriers women and girls still face the financing gaps for gender equality and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact And how the world cannot afford to sideline womens voices expertise and leadership any longer because when women lead communities thrive economies grow and societies become more just
In my years of advocacy Ive also learned that sometimes proximity is everything Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard
A year ago I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open Today I find myself leading conversations that shape the future
But this is not just my story It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream It is the story of every young advocate every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work to the learning to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens
This is why I do what I do

My adventure in social media began seven years ago when I decided to share my passion with the world Starting with just 1000 followers I posted about my love for lifestyle travel beauty and fashion I remember feeling a rush every time someone liked or commented on my posts
It was a slow climb but I was determined to grow my community Through trial and error I learned the ins and outs of social media all on my own I spent countless hours researching trends experimenting with different types of content and engaging with my followers I embraced my authenticity sharing my unique story and it paid offI eventually grew my Instagram follower count missfashioncupid to over 100000
Once I arrived in NYC that growth had no limit Just a highlight I got the incredible opportunity to go to New York Fashion Week 2024 as a Creator Guest for Runway 7 and to walk as a model for the brand ELJ Avenue and the Indian brand KHOOB at NYFW

Sometimes it can be tiring to attend all these events but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward I realize this is something I cant afford to tire of its too important for my growth and journey
For new students like me the fastpaced NYC environment can be a bit overwhelming Here are a few tricks to help you stay connected and involved

The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies analyze consumer behavior and apply datadriven insightsall of which Ive started integrating into my influencer work These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goalscreating winwin partnerships
As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me the professors the classmates the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey The path ahead is full of potential and Im excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing

From the bustling streets of Harare Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery Growing up in Zimbabwe a country rich in culture and resilience I embarked on a career in banking starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact My story is also one of adaptation and growth from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change

My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to mefreedom opportunity and a rich diverse history Coming from Harare I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings
On the other hand Central Park feels like home Its my goto place to escape the hustle and bustle unwind and enjoy some peace and tranquility Theres something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the citys energy in a way thats comforting and familiar

Discovering the Magic of Central Park
I used to live in Siberia where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bonechilling 36 degrees below zero Amid those harsh conditions I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park which I kept as my desktop screensaver This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold and it kindled a dream within me I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize
Last year I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality Central Park once a distant daydream now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams
Every Sunday I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty enjoy a picnic and soak up the atmosphere Central Park to me has become more than just a scenic escape its a testament to the power of belief It proves that dreams no matter how big or seemingly impossible can come true for those who refuse to give up
Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park
   Its a wideopen field with a view of skyscrapers perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends
  This historic structure is one of the first built in the park I love walking here admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians Fun fact you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2
   I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my onceimpossible dream had come true
   One of the most iconic features of Central Park this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake
   Also known as Central Park Reservoir it covers a significant portion of the parks surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline
Central Park isnt just a fairweather friend It boasts yearround attractions cherry blossoms in the spring between 72nd and 96th streets iceskating rinks in winter and biking in the summer
To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and indeed New York City theres no better way than strolling its paths On foot you can discover your own personal power place a spot that will pull you back time and time again For me that power spot is Central Park It isnt just a destination its an embodiment of dreams an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers wherever we are from

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School The curriculum integrates realworld projects providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure From the very beginning I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career
Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship and Dr Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions respectively Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty
In addition to my studies Im a research assistant under Dr Margarita Vigodner professor of biology at YUs Stern College for Women studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells In her lab we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation This helps us to validate some of the identified targets which play an important role in spermatogenesis as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells We used gelelectrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr Vigodner but Ive also profited just from working beside an experienced and wellrespected researcher
Outside the lab I serve as vice president of the  In this role Im able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture Last fall the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students strengthening their networks and increasing the size of their social circle These events provided a muchneeded opportunity for students to unwind and destress
Personally one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York Citys rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions So far Ive visited Times Square the Brooklyn Bridge Central Park and St Patricks Cathedral and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate
My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn and you will be amazed at the doors that will open
My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of lifechanging After I graduate next year I plan to become a lifesciences consultant assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products I hadnt considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills experiences and relationships Ive gained at the Katz School

NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home I feel at home at the Katz School because of the kind and supportive atmosphere it offers If you ever need somebody to cheer you on or join in on an activity your professors and friends are always there Most notably Dr Khan Dr Vigodner and Dr Natasha were there for me through thick and thin Whenever there has been a storm Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter much like an umbrella

Best NYC Study Spots
Even in New York Citys bustling environment you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience exploring the citys arts music architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration
Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the citys diverse offerings Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study
One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the NepaliAmerican community With 500 of my countrymen looking on NYCs Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eightfoottall Nepali flag in Manhattans Bowling Green Park in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center
New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York Citys South Asian communities It was quite a moment because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud
I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva Universitys reputation for educational excellence the abundance of economic opportunity and because its home to 70000 Nepalese immigrants
Here are my favorite study spots in New York City
1 476 5th Ave at 42nd Street  My top pick for inspiring study spaces New York Citys flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions
2 in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets  If studying outdoors is your thing be sure to check out this 15acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park

Parisian Flair meets New York Hustle
Im Diane Schrenzel originally from Paris France now pursuing my MS in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva Universitys Katz School of Science and Health in NYC Alongside my studies I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm crafting strategies for success
My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major another passion of mine
Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID19 pandemic I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years This role solidified my interest in business and marketing prompting me to pursue my masters degree at the Katz School of Science and Health

Chinese New Year Celebration 2024 Year of the Dragon
By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao
The ChineseJewish Conversation CJC and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus Yagoda Commons  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions music games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine For Yining Zhang a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad He noted that it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the worldand to learn about the Jewish New Year
For Chinese students far from home the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community Known also as the Spring Festival the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture Culminating in the Lantern Festival it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two
Ms Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr Mordechai Cohen the Director of the CJC Dr Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare He explained that the Jewish New Year Rosh haShanah is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar In contrast the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice Interestingly this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevatspecifically the New Year for Trees a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon or Tu BiShevat the 15th of Shevat which coincides with Chinas Lantern Festival Dr Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year as they did in 2023 and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year
After the lecture an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience with prizes awarded to the winners Some of the Chinese participants including Ms He were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture
No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song and the evening was no exception with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics The audience was particularly moved when Dr Cohen accompanied by his son Elisha YUHSB 24 performed a beloved traditional Chinese song The Moon Represents My Heart The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures Elisha who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir also shared Hebrew songs adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening
The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games including lucky draw and a chopsticks pingpong ball competition With the latter the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students The winners received traditional Red Packets with a gift card
The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended  For Stern College student Breindy Berger the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful  I found the quiz fascinating and the pingpong game a lot of fun Chaya Goldberger her classmate added I learned how to say Happy New Year in Chinese from my new friend Xinyue Huang It was such a fantastic event Wei Luo a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration It allowed us Chinese students studying abroad to feel the festivals warmth and blessings

From Zambia to the UN
For as long as I can remember I have always believed that the world should be a place where everyone has the opportunity to become something where young girls can dream without limits where voices from the margins are heard at the center and where the belief in what could be is stronger than the fear of what is
But life has also taught me that belief alone isnt enough It takes action It takes showing up even when youre unsure It takes stepping into spaces where you once felt like an outsider and owning the moment as if you were always meant to be there
From my early advocacy years I have intentionally been involved with organizations that believed in the power of young people to lead change I found my voice through organizations like The Center for Young Leaders in Africa CYLA When Females Lead and Girls Gone Political These organizations pushed me refined me and prepared me for bigger moments to come They taught me that no seat at the table is too big no stage too grand and no issue too complex for young people to lead on
On February 5 2025 I found myself in one of those moments as I stood at the United Nations headquarters leading a highlevel session with global leaders and experts on SDG 5 Gender Equality at the 2025 ECOSOC Partnership Forum As the youth representative for the Major Group for Children and Youth MGCY Gender Youth Caucus I was entrusted with guiding discussions on one of the most critical issues of our time
The company was both humbling and inspiring I was privileged to be joined by HE Ambassador AlWasil  Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the UN and Chair of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women Shawyn PattersonHoward  Mayor of Mount Vernon New York Aarushi Khanna  AsiaPacific Regional Lead Equal Measures 2030 Foteini Papagioti  Deputy Director of Policy  Advocacy International Center for Research on Women ICRW Olela Tonny  Gender Expert Child Protection  SRHR Advocate and Diene Keita  Deputy Executive Director of Programme UNFPA
The conversation was urgent necessary and deeply personal We discussed barriers women and girls still face the financing gaps for gender equality and how multi stakeholder partnerships can drive real impact And how the world cannot afford to sideline womens voices expertise and leadership any longer because when women lead communities thrive economies grow and societies become more just
In my years of advocacy Ive also learned that sometimes proximity is everything Studying at Katz School of Science and Health in New York City has been a springboard for these global opportunities and has given me access to rooms where young people are not just seen but heard
A year ago I spoke on the sidelines of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Women for the first time never knowing that it would be a catalyst for even bigger doors to open Today I find myself leading conversations that shape the future
But this is not just my story It is the story of every young girl in Zambia who dares to dream It is the story of every young advocate every changemaker who refuses to settle for the world as it is and dares to imagine it as it should be Our wildest dreams are not as far away as they seem They are waiting for us to keep showing up to the work to the learning to the uncomfortable spaces where growth happens
This is why I do what I do

Sometimes it can be tiring to attend all these events but my inner drive motivates me and pushes me forward I realize this is something I cant afford to tire of its too important for my growth and journey

The Digital Marketing and Media program has enhanced my existing knowledge by giving me tools and frameworks to evaluate brand strategies analyze consumer behavior and apply datadriven insightsall of which Ive started integrating into my influencer work These insights have been instrumental in helping me identify opportunities to collaborate with brands more effectively and to align my creative vision with business goalscreating winwin partnerships
As I look back on my journey as a student and social media creator in NYC I feel a sense of gratitude for all the experiences that have shaped me the professors the classmates the mentors and collaborators who have shaped my journey The path ahead is full of potential and Im excited to explore what the future holds in digital marketing

From the bustling streets of Harare Zimbabwe to the towering skyscrapers of New York City my journey has been one of relentless ambition and transformative discovery Growing up in Zimbabwe a country rich in culture and resilience I embarked on a career in banking starting humbly as a teller and rising through the ranks to become a chief teller Each step was fueled by a passion for learning and a desire to make a significant impact My story is also one of adaptation and growth from mastering the intricacies of financial management to diving into the dynamic world of digital marketing driven by a vision to harness the power of innovation to create meaningful change

My favorite spots in NYC are the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island because they represent so much of what makes New York City special to mefreedom opportunity and a rich diverse history Coming from Harare I see parallels between these landmarks and the stories of people in my homeland striving for better lives and new beginnings
On the other hand Central Park feels like home Its my goto place to escape the hustle and bustle unwind and enjoy some peace and tranquility Theres something about the natural beauty and open spaces that makes me feel grounded and connected to the citys energy in a way thats comforting and familiar

Discovering the Magic of Central Park
I used to live in Siberia where winter days were dark and temperatures often plummeted to a bonechilling 36 degrees below zero Amid those harsh conditions I found an unexpected source of solace in a simple image of Central Park which I kept as my desktop screensaver This serene picture served as a daily escape from the bitter cold and it kindled a dream within me I yearned to live near Central Park and pursue my graduate degree Little did I know that this dream would eventually materialize
Last year I was admitted to the Katz School of Science and Health which gave me the opportunity to move to New York City and make that dream a reality Central Park once a distant daydream now stands as a vivid symbol of perseverance and a powerful reminder of the tangible strength of our dreams
Every Sunday I head to Central Park with my best friend to take in its beauty enjoy a picnic and soak up the atmosphere Central Park to me has become more than just a scenic escape its a testament to the power of belief It proves that dreams no matter how big or seemingly impossible can come true for those who refuse to give up
Here are a few of my favorite spots in Central Park
   Its a wideopen field with a view of skyscrapers perfect for picnics or playing frisbee with friends
  This historic structure is one of the first built in the park I love walking here admiring the architecture and listening to street musicians Fun fact you can see Bethesda Fountain featured in movies like Home Alone 2 and John Wick 2
   I highly recommend visiting this spot at least once for an unbeatable rooftop view of New York City This is the spot that reminds me most of the picture I had on my desktop in Siberia and seeing it in person was when it really hit me that my onceimpossible dream had come true
   One of the most iconic features of Central Park this bridge is a romantic and frequently photographed spot with a view of the lake
   Also known as Central Park Reservoir it covers a significant portion of the parks surface and offers runners one of the best views of the city skyline
Central Park isnt just a fairweather friend It boasts yearround attractions cherry blossoms in the spring between 72nd and 96th streets iceskating rinks in winter and biking in the summer
To truly unlock the magic of Central Park and indeed New York City theres no better way than strolling its paths On foot you can discover your own personal power place a spot that will pull you back time and time again For me that power spot is Central Park It isnt just a destination its an embodiment of dreams an emblem of hope and a sanctuary for all New Yorkers wherever we are from

I came to New York wanting a unique experience that combined biotechnology and entrepreneurship which is exactly why I chose the  at the Katz School The curriculum integrates realworld projects providing an important platform for learning and the chance to make mistakes without fear of failure From the very beginning I have had access to professors who deeply understand both biotechnology and entrepreneurship offering invaluable insights that are already giving shape to my professional career
Professor Robert Friedman has been especially helpful providing career advice and facilitating an interview for a summer internship and Dr Rana Khan and Natasha Shtraizent went above and beyond in their efforts to connect me with potential internship opportunities at Yeshiva University and the startup FREEZENT Biological Solutions respectively Their willingness to lend their time and expertise to support my career aspirations is a testament to the dedication of the faculty
In addition to my studies Im a research assistant under Dr Margarita Vigodner professor of biology at YUs Stern College for Women studying the effect of SUMOylation on the germ cells of mice and how it affects the growth and development of mouse sperm cells In her lab we use ginkgolic acid and siRNA to inhibit SUMOylation This helps us to validate some of the identified targets which play an important role in spermatogenesis as well as glean insights into how SUMO controls mechanisms in germ cells We used gelelectrophoresis and western blotting techniques to observe the results of the inhibition of SUMOylation on the targeted proteins Not only have I received academic credit for my work with Dr Vigodner but Ive also profited just from working beside an experienced and wellrespected researcher
Outside the lab I serve as vice president of the  In this role Im able to enhance the campus experience for my peers and contribute to a vibrant Katz School culture Last fall the GSA organized three events aimed at facilitating meaningful connections between students strengthening their networks and increasing the size of their social circle These events provided a muchneeded opportunity for students to unwind and destress
Personally one of the unexpected joys of attending the Katz School is being exposed to New York Citys rich cultural heritage and iconic attractions So far Ive visited Times Square the Brooklyn Bridge Central Park and St Patricks Cathedral and there are several more destinations on my bucket list that I plan to visit before I graduate
My advice to incoming Katz School students is to seize the opportunities for personal and professional growth that the school provides Approach every new experience with enthusiasm and a desire to learn and you will be amazed at the doors that will open
My time so far at the Katz School has been nothing short of lifechanging After I graduate next year I plan to become a lifesciences consultant assisting biopharmaceutical companies with the launch of new products I hadnt considered this line of work until Professor Friedman impressed upon me the importance of taking risks in pursuing my passion I now feel confident in the direction my life is taking and I owe much of this to the skills experiences and relationships Ive gained at the Katz School

Favorite Spots in NYC Time Square Brooklyn Bridge
NYC Spot that Feels Most Like Home I feel at home at the Katz School because of the kind and supportive atmosphere it offers If you ever need somebody to cheer you on or join in on an activity your professors and friends are always there Most notably Dr Khan Dr Vigodner and Dr Natasha were there for me through thick and thin Whenever there has been a storm Dean Paul Russo and the rest of Katz have been there to give shelter much like an umbrella

Best NYC Study Spots
Even in New York Citys bustling environment you can find peaceful spots to concentrate and foster innovation For those seeking an inspiring atmosphere to enhance their learning experience exploring the citys arts music architecture and historical sites can provide a rich source of inspiration
Stepping outside the confines of my apartment allowed me to immerse myself in the vibrant cultural scene and draw inspiration from the citys diverse offerings Exploring the city also helped me find some great places to study
One of the highlights of my time at the Katz School was when I was recognized at a special event honoring the NepaliAmerican community With 500 of my countrymen looking on NYCs Mayor Eric Adams hoisted an eightfoottall Nepali flag in Manhattans Bowling Green Park in front of the iconic Charging Bull sculpture on Wall Street near the World Trade Center
New York State Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar presented me with a First Certificate of Merit for my volunteer efforts with the Minority Empowerment Network which promotes mental health awareness and economic empowerment of New York Citys South Asian communities It was quite a moment because Nepal is a very small country and having our flag fly beside the flag of the United States made me and the Nepali community especially proud
I chose New York City to further my education because of Yeshiva Universitys reputation for educational excellence the abundance of economic opportunity and because its home to 70000 Nepalese immigrants
Here are my favorite study spots in New York City
1 476 5th Ave at 42nd Street  My top pick for inspiring study spaces New York Citys flagship public library houses an extensive research collection and offers many public programs and exhibitions
2 in Central Park between 66th and 69th Streets  If studying outdoors is your thing be sure to check out this 15acre meadow near the southwestern section of Central Park
3  197 E 3rd St  Great independent bookstore and bar in the East Village
4  Beren Campus 245 Lexington Ave  Great place for quiet study and research support You can also reserve private group study rooms

Cybersecurity beyond Borders
Growing up in Colombia I always had a curiosity for the world beyond my own borders So when the opportunity arose to study abroad there was no hesitation New York City with its bustling streets and melting pot of cultures called out to me Its the capital of diversity a place where you can meet people from every corner of the globe Studying in such an environment promised growth both personally and professionally and I couldnt resist

In the cybersecurity program I found a community of likeminded individuals many of whom like me came from abroad The programs emphasis on realworld applicability and networking events like Cybertech provided invaluable experiences Each class discussion was enriched by the diverse perspectives we all brought to the table
If I had to pick a favorite class it would be Security Architecture with Professor Nicole Becher Exploring the intricacies of AWS Azure and Google Cloud has been both fascinating and eyeopening Professor Bechers passion for the subject is contagious making every lecture a stimulating experience

Im Diane Schrenzel originally from Paris France now pursuing my MS in Digital Marketing and Media at Yeshiva Universitys Katz School of Science and Health in NYC Alongside my studies I lead marketing efforts focusing on web and data analytics for a startup My journey blends Parisian flair with New York hustle as I navigate the digital realm crafting strategies for success
My journey into marketing began back in high school when I took an online marketing class and found it captivating After moving to the United States to attend Wellesley College I delved deeper into business classes at MIT Sloan while pursuing my art history major another passion of mine
Upon graduating in 2020 amidst the COVID19 pandemic I found myself managing an antique store in Midtown Manhattan leveraging my experience from internships at art auction houses during my undergraduate years This role solidified my interest in business and marketing prompting me to pursue my masters degree at the Katz School of Science and Health
New York Citys vibrant atmosphere and cultural richness have always drawn me in reminiscent of the energy I love about Paris The bustling cityscape combined with Katz Schools diverse student body and esteemed faculty made it an easy choice for me
My favorite spot in the city is Angelina a French cafe nestled in Bryant Park where I indulge in their delectable pastries and signature MontBlanc For a dose of culture I frequent the Metropolitan Museum of Art reveling in its everchanging exhibits
What I appreciate most about the Katz School is its inclusivity and the wealth of realworld experience offered by the professors The personalized attention and supportive environment have truly made me feel at home

Chinese New Year Celebration 2024 Year of the Dragon
By Ran Zhong and Chengkun Yao
The ChineseJewish Conversation CJC and the Katz School of Science and Health celebrated the Chinese Year of the Dragon at Beren Campus Yagoda Commons  More than 90 students and faculty came together for a lively evening of cultural exchange and festivities The event highlighted the shared lunar calendar of the Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions through educational discussions music games and an abundance of kosher Chinese cuisine For Yining Zhang a Katz student majoring in digital media and marketing the event marked the first time he celebrated the Spring Festival abroad He noted that it was a chance to experience the lively New Year atmosphere with classmates from all over the worldand to learn about the Jewish New Year
For Chinese students far from home the evening was a time to connect with both old and new friends while sharing their traditions with the wider YU community Known also as the Spring Festival the Lunar New Year is the most significant festival in Chinese culture Culminating in the Lantern Festival it is traditionally a time when families gather for a week or two
Ms Kedi He from Beijing hosted the event and introduced Dr Mordechai Cohen the Director of the CJC Dr Cohen shared his insights on how the Chinese and Jewish New Year celebrations and calendars compare He explained that the Jewish New Year Rosh haShanah is celebrated on the new moon of the seventh month in the Jewish lunar calendar In contrast the Chinese Spring Festival is marked on the second new moon after the winter solstice Interestingly this often aligns with the Jewish month of Shevatspecifically the New Year for Trees a date based on one interpretation in the Talmud Another Talmudic view places this celebration at the full moon or Tu BiShevat the 15th of Shevat which coincides with Chinas Lantern Festival Dr Cohen pointed out a fascinating occurrence these celebrations can align after a Jewish leap year as they did in 2023 and they will align again in 2025 due to this year being a Jewish leap year
After the lecture an engaging quiz game on Chinese and Jewish New Year traditions captivated the audience with prizes awarded to the winners Some of the Chinese participants including Ms He were joined by their parents who traveled from China to New York for the New Year The visiting family members were delighted to be part of the festivities as well learn about Jewish rituals and culture
No Chinese celebration is complete without music and song and the evening was no exception with attendees enjoying karaoke renditions of many Chinese classics The audience was particularly moved when Dr Cohen accompanied by his son Elisha YUHSB 24 performed a beloved traditional Chinese song The Moon Represents My Heart The Chinese students felt as though they were back in their hometowns with many commenting on how the magic of music bridged the gap between Chinese and Jewish cultures Elisha who is a member of the Miami Boys Choir also shared Hebrew songs adding a beautiful note of cultural harmony to the evening
The festivities featured a variety of Chinese games including lucky draw and a chopsticks pingpong ball competition With the latter the Chinese students were pleasantly surprised to be outperformed by some of the Stern College students The winners received traditional Red Packets with a gift card
The colorful evening proved a memorable experience for all who attended  For Stern College student Breindy Berger the Chinese New Year celebration was truly meaningful  I found the quiz fascinating and the pingpong game a lot of fun Chaya Goldberger her classmate added I learned how to say Happy New Year in Chinese from my new friend Xinyue Huang It was such a fantastic event Wei Luo a Digital Arts and Visualization major at the Katz School expressed a heartfelt thank you to the CJC team of Yeshiva University and Dr Cohen for organizing the New Year celebration It allowed us Chinese

Professor Wins Awards for Quantum Systems
Dr Lea Ferreira dos Santos professor of physics and chair of the physics department at Stern College for Women has received two major awards that will significantly help her advance the computational study of manybody quantum systems
In 2019 Dr Santos received a 400000 National Science Foundation grant to study Nonequilibrium Quantum Matter Timescales and SelfAveraging The grant is a collaboration between the NSF and the USIsrael Binational Science Foundation BSF that reduced barriers to working internationally Using a lead agency model US and Israeli researchers can submit a single collaborative proposal that will undergo a single review process at NSF which will be the lead agency
This collaboration noted Dr Santos will allow for the combination of complementary skills and will significantly expand the NSFPIs group size and computer resources A further benefit of the collaboration will be that the undergraduate students of Yeshiva University will have the opportunity to experience research at a PhDgranting institution in Israel
This award supports computational and theoretical studies of the evolution of systems that have many interacting particles and which are described by quantum mechanics These socalled manybody quantum systems are so complex that it is often impossible to describe their evolution analytically which forces us to resort to numerical methods But even numerically the problem is challenging Because the number of states that need to be considered grows exponentially with system size existing computers soon run out of memory As a result despite being ubiquitous these systems are still little understood Understanding the properties of manybody quantum systems out of equilibrium is a fundamental problem of great interest to a wide range of fields from atomic molecular and condensed matter physics to quantum information and cosmology These studies may also lead to practical applications
Dr Santos also received notice that she had been selected as a Simons Fellows in Theoretical Physics by the Simons Foundation an organization dedicated to advancing the frontiers of research in mathematics and the basic sciences The selection includes a 100000 grant to support sabbatical research leaves from classroom teaching and administrative obligations and is based on the applicants scientific accomplishments in the fiveyear period preceding the application and on the potential scientific impact of the work to be done during the leave period
Dr Santos project will be Nonequilibrium Quantum Dynamics of ManyBody Systems and as she explained it the grant will give her the time and space to expand her current program of studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics by allowing her to initiate a new research line develop computer codes strengthen current collaborations and establish new ones and write proposals
Of course Dr Santos is thrilled by these awards not only for the way they help her advance her career but also for the positive notice they bring to Yeshiva University Im especially pleased she noted that the NSF grant will help my undergraduate students at Stern College work with leaders in the field and across the two countries The Simons fellowship is a very prestigious award and Im humbled by being included in the exceptional company of the past awardees
Both Dr Selma Botman provost and vice president for academic affairs and Dr Karen Bacon the Mordecai D Katz and Dr Monique C Katz Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty of Arts and Sciences were both thrilled to hear the news We are so very very proud of her achievements said Dr Bacon as well as of this recognition of her as an exceptional scientist and scholar

About Accreditation and Outcomes
At its March 2024 meeting the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant Inc ARCPA placed the Yeshiva University Physician Assistant Program sponsored by Yeshiva University on AccreditationProbation status until its next review in March 2026
Probation accreditation is a temporary accreditation status initially of not less than two years However that period may be extended by the ARCPA for up to an additional two years if the ARCPA finds that the program is making substantial progress toward meeting all applicable standards but requires additional time to come into full compliance Probation accreditation status is granted at the sole discretion of the ARCPA when a program holding an accreditation status of Accreditation  Provisional or Accreditation  Continued does not in the judgment of the ARCPA meet the Standards or when the capability of the program to provide an acceptable educational experience for its students is threatened
Once placed on probation a program that fails to comply with accreditation requirements in a timely manner as specified by the ARCPA may be scheduled for a focused site visit and is subject to having its accreditation withdrawn
The Yeshiva University Physician Assistant Program is scheduled for a focused site visit in advance of the March 2025 commission meeting This visit will evaluate the PA Program and institutional progress in addressing specific citations identified during the course of the most recent commission review of the PA Program Failure of the PA Program and institution to demonstrate significant progress in addressing these citations is likely to result in the withdrawal of accreditation
Specific questions regarding the program and its plans should be directed to the program director andor the appropriate institutional officials
The programs accreditation history can be viewed on the ARCPA website at

TwoStep Verification System Using Face Recognition
Research Presentation TwoStep Verification System Using Face Recognition
Presented by Mukilan Narayanamoorthy  MS in Cybersecurity
Abstract As technology use increases rapidly across the globe the number of active social media users has reached 37 billion within just the past three years This increasing demand urges social network companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of the user Several companies have introduced twostep verification mechanisms like verification codes and graphical passwords but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques like SIM hijacking To identify a more secure environment we researched three approachesaHash pHash and dHashto determine which offers the greatest protection of authenticity Our findings suggest that dHash is the best approach and one can use the combination of facial recognition and cryptography to safely ensure the authenticity of the user

Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data
Research Presentation Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data
Presented by Benjamin Cohen MS in Data Analytics and Visualization
Abstract Traditionally audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms In the past few years however a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process easier This project applies deeplearning methods to speechemotion recognition the ability to discern a persons emotions solely from their tone of voice To do this we gathered a base dataset of around 1400 audio clips labeled as angry or not angry augmented the dataset using a generative model and then used transfer learning with a pretrained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not ultimately achieving accuracy of greater than 90 percent This work is important because it shows that deeplearning approaches work very well with audio data and that not much data is needed because its possible to augment datasets

ForceIndentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects
Research Presentation ForceIndentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects
Presented by Benjamin Goykadosh  MA in Physics
Abstract Currently there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells These methods however are computationally slow and require intensive testing outside of the body In this project we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force versus indentation curves produced by the deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope which is necessary to understand cell contraction and deformation The theory depends on parameters such as Youngs modulus object length and Poissons ratio and is obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force versus indentation curves Thus our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters in general but particularly in a soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and where their properties are often dependent on external stresses

A Proposed Novel Drug Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
Research Presentation A Proposed Novel TwoDrug Combination Topical Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
Presented by Jonathan Taub  MS in Biotechnology Management  Entrepreneurship
Abstract Actinic keratosis AK and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cSCC incidences have increased exponentially over the last halfcentury even as methods of diagnosis and diagnostic definitions themselves remain malleable An estimated twothirds of all AK and cSCC patients are over the age of 65 possibly presenting a public health concern One group of AK and cSCC sufferers that might find themselves with more restricted options in a crowded therapeutic field are immunocompromised patients particularly patients with transplants GritBIO proposes a combination of two drugsmiltefosine and carmofurin a novel composition for topical administration which would provide the requisite cytotoxicity without the attendant adverse effects on immune cells This project aims to understand the market IP constrains regulatory requirements and the potential for fasttrack designation for this treatment

Abstract SUMO proteins are essential for normal development and are expressed in mouse and human Sertoli cells However the cellspecific role of sumoylation in those cells has only started to be elucidated In other cell types including granulosa cells sumoylation is regulated by a SUMO ligase KAP1Trim28 Deletion of KAP1 in Sertoli cells causes testicular degeneration but the role of KAP1 in those cells has not been identified In addition the molecular regulation of Sertoli cells and their crosstalk with germ cells has not been fully characterized Here we show that both mouse and human Sertoli undergo apoptosis upon inhibition of sumoylation with a chemical inhibitor or via a siRNA technology We have additionally detected changes in the Sertoli cell proteome upon the inhibition of sumoylation and our data suggest that among others the expression of ERstressrelated proteins is highly affected by this inhibition Sumoylation may also regulate the NOTCH signaling which is important for the maintenance of the developing germ cells Furthermore we show that a siRNAdownregulation of KAP1 in a Sertoliderived cell line causes an almost complete inactivation of sumoylation In conclusion sumoylation regulates important survival and signaling pathways in Sertoli cells and KAP1 can be a major regulator of sumoylation in these cells

TwoStep Verification System Using Face Recognition
Research Presentation TwoStep Verification System Using Face Recognition
Presented by Mukilan Narayanamoorthy  MS in Cybersecurity
Abstract As technology use increases rapidly across the globe the number of active social media users has reached 37 billion within just the past three years This increasing demand urges social network companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of the user Several companies have introduced twostep verification mechanisms like verification codes and graphical passwords but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques like SIM hijacking To identify a more secure environment we researched three approachesaHash pHash and dHashto determine which offers the greatest protection of authenticity Our findings suggest that dHash is the best approach and one can use the combination of facial recognition and cryptography to safely ensure the authenticity of the user

Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data
Research Presentation Speech Emotion Recognition With Generative Data
Presented by Benjamin Cohen MS in Data Analytics and Visualization
Abstract Traditionally audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms In the past few years however a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process easier This project applies deeplearning methods to speechemotion recognition the ability to discern a persons emotions solely from their tone of voice To do this we gathered a base dataset of around 1400 audio clips labeled as angry or not angry augmented the dataset using a generative model and then used transfer learning with a pretrained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not ultimately achieving accuracy of greater than 90 percent This work is important because it shows that deeplearning approaches work very well with audio data and that not much data is needed because its possible to augment datasets

ForceIndentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects
Research Presentation ForceIndentation Curves Of Spheroidal Objects
Presented by Benjamin Goykadosh  MA in Physics
Abstract Currently there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells These methods however are computationally slow and require intensive testing outside of the body In this project we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force versus indentation curves produced by the deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope which is necessary to understand cell contraction and deformation The theory depends on parameters such as Youngs modulus object length and Poissons ratio and is obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force versus indentation curves Thus our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters in general but particularly in a soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and where their properties are often dependent on external stresses

A Proposed Novel Drug Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
Research Presentation A Proposed Novel TwoDrug Combination Topical Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
Presented by Jonathan Taub  MS in Biotechnology Management  Entrepreneurship
Abstract Actinic keratosis AK and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cSCC incidences have increased exponentially over the last halfcentury even as methods of diagnosis and diagnostic definitions themselves remain malleable An estimated twothirds of all AK and cSCC patients are over the age of 65 possibly presenting a public health concern One group of AK and cSCC sufferers that might find themselves with more restricted options in a crowded therapeutic field are immunocompromised patients particularly patients with transplants GritBIO proposes a combination of two drugsmiltefosine and carmofurin a novel composition for topical administration which would provide the requisite cytotoxicity without the attendant adverse effects on immune cells This project aims to understand the market IP constrains regulatory requirements and the potential for fasttrack designation for this treatment

Abstract This project aimed to identify the most secure and efficient approach to user authentication for social networking sites As technology use increases rapidly across the globe the number of active social media users has reached 37 billion within just the last three years This increasing demand urges social networking companies to introduce more and better security mechanisms to protect the authenticity of their users Several companies have introduced twostep verification mechanisms like verification codes and graphical passwords but these can easily be compromised with simple techniques like sim hijacking To create a more secure environment this paper proposes a twofactor facialrecognition authentication engine using a dHash algorithm

Abstract This project aimed to apply deep learning methods to classify audio data Traditionally audio classification has been studied by manually selecting features from spectrograms However in the past few years a lot of interest has been raised about how deep learning can make this process more effective This project applied deep learning methods to speech emotion recognition the ability to discern a persons emotions solely from their tone of voice To do this we gathered a base dataset of approximately 1400 audio clips labeled as angry or not angry augmented the dataset using a generative model and then used transfer learning with a pretrained Yamnet model to predict whether the clip was angry or not Ultimately our predictions achieved accuracy greater than 90 percent This work demonstrates that deep learning approaches work well with audio data and even with limited data as it is possible to augment datasets

Abstract In this project we propose a theoretical method to recover the energy and force vs indentation curves produced by deformation using an Atomic Force Microscope Currently there are many methods to determine the forces and energy necessary to deform cells These methods however are slow and require testing outside of the body Our theory depends on parameters such as Youngs Modulus object length and Poissons ratio which are obtained by fitting our mathematical expressions to experimental force vs indentation curves Our results provide a systematic way to measure those material parameters in general and in particular in soft matter where the materials are highly heterogeneous and their properties are often dependent on external stresses

Abstract This project conducted on behalf of therapeutics startup GritBio aimed to understand the market landscape for a novel topical treatment of Actinic keratosis AK Incidence of AK remains underestimated and AK management may soon become a public health issue due to aging populations and the risks of transformation to squamous cell carcinomas SCCs While there are numerous treatment options for AK no data have been published regarding the overall effectiveness of these therapies Immunocompromised AK and SCC sufferers particularly those with transplants might find even more restricted treatment options in a crowded therapeutic field as current treatments fail to address their increased vulnerability to toxic side effects GritBio proposes a combination of two drugsmiltefosine and carmofurin a novel composition for topical administration for the treatment of AK which would provide the requisite cytotoxicity without the attendant adverse effects on immune cells This project provides background on AK classification existing treatment options and the potential market for GritBios new treatment option Findings suggest a large potential market for GritBios proposed treatment particularly among transplant and immunosuppressed patients

Abstract This study aimed to show that KAP1 regulates SUMOylation in testicular Sertoli cells The molecular regulation of Sertoli cells and their crosstalk with germ cells has not been fully characterized Smallubiquitinrelated modifier SUMO proteins are essential for normal sperm development and are expressed in mouse and human Sertoli cells However the cellspecific role of SUMOylation in those cells has only started to be elucidated In other cell types including granulosa cells SUMOylation is regulated by a SUMO ligase KAP1Trim28 Deletion of KAP1 in Sertoli cells causes testicular degeneration However the role of KAP1 in those cells has not been identified The results of this study show that both murine and human Sertoli cells undergo apoptosis upon inhibition of SUMOylation with a chemical inhibitor or via a siRNA technology coupled with changes in the Sertoli cell proteome Findings suggest that among others the expression of ERstressrelated proteins is highly affected by this inhibition SUMOylation may also regulate the NOTCH signaling  which is important for the maintenance of the developing germ cells Furthermore siRNAdownregulation of KAP1 in a Sertoliderived cell line causes an almost complete inactivation of SUMOylation In conclusion SUMOylation regulates important survival and signaling pathways in Sertoli cells and KAP1 can be a major regulator of SUMOylation in these cells

Abstract This study explored the application of Capture the Flag CTF events as an instructional approach in cybersecurity and information security IS curricula In a classroom environment technical skills can sometimes be overshadowed by theoretical knowledge CTF events remove those barriers by allowing cybersecurity and IS students to use any tools in their arsenal to complete challenges related to the subject matter CTF challenges range in difficulty and give students a snapshot of problems they may face in the real world While CTF events are commonly used in the professional arena they are often overlooked in academic settings because they are considered too gamified In this project we hypothesized that incorporating CTF events into the core IS and cybersecurity curriculum could promote students learning and ultimately increase their chance of employment The findings of this preliminary study support the use of CTF events as an instructional approach to support cybersecurity and IS students learning Further research is warranted

Abstract This collaborative project between Yeshiva Universitys Katz School of Science and Health and SP Global Market Intelligence sought to quantify the financial effects of tropical cyclones on the US real estate market Using hurricane data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC and proprietary real estate trust data from SP databases we analyzed the growing impact of tropical cyclones in the United States as well as the relationships between climate change and Real Estate Investment Trust REITs financial losses The analysis shows a relationship between the increasing frequency of hurricanes and the financial impact on RIETs suggesting that REIT owning companies should invest in property risk mitigation expenditures before significant damage is done to their assets by tropical cyclones

Abstract This paper provides a review of scholarly sources aiming to identify the possible effects of dual language exposure for individuals with central auditory processing disorder CAPD CAPD is a cognitively and auditorily demanding deficit affecting a persons ability to internally process sounds It becomes increasingly difficult for an individual with CAPD to isolate process andor comprehend sounds in overwhelming listening situations Dual language exposure is also cognitively and auditorily demanding however research has shown it to be advantageous stimulating auditory processing and increasing processing effectiveness in demanding listening situations Based on a review of literature it was found that for individuals with CAPD dual language exposure may be more of a hindrance than a benefit potentially leading to confusion in either language In addition to specifying potential consequences and benefits this paper provides implications for speechlanguage pathologists SLPs working with individuals concerned

Probing Connection Between Bending Light and Its Atomic Origin
New paper by physics chair Dr Fredy Zypman considers the the atomic origin of refraction

Probing Connection Between Bending Light and Its Atomic Origin
In his paper Permittivity from First Principles published in September by  Dr Zypman considers the explicit connection between refraction and its atomic origin and proposes a mathematical model to gain physical insight on permittivity a property related to refraction
Refraction occurs when light moves from one substance to another changing speed and direction The index of refraction is the relationship between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in a substance Matter around usin plastics liquids our skin the airhave characteristic electrical properties said Dr Zypman When the electrical field travels from one medium to another light must adjust to the local environment Thats why we see shadows and reflectionsthose rich sources of optical sensationsall around us
We aimed to produce a clear conceptual pathway between the atomic polarization and the familiar refraction he said The main focus of the study is to produce exact expressions for the permittivity to all orders of an electric field that is valid for any intensity of light and to compute the permittivity for typical materials

Occupational Therapy Research Addresses Societal Needs
While the core function of an occupational therapist is to help people live their lives to the fullest by supporting their independence the Katz Schools  takes that mission a step further by asking students to consider the wider implications of their scholarshipto fill an urgent societal need or a gap in the academic literature At a recent Capstone Dissemination Day the results of that programmatic effort were vividly on display
Seven projects were presented by eight recently graduated OT doctoral students Researchoriented projects included the impact of manual dexterity on the cognition of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis Dr Rinu Abraham promoting student resiliency and academic performance Dr Noah Frydman and the development of standardized educational modules to ensure the integrity of researchers Dr Deena Motechin and Dr Avani Patel
Projects involving the development of programs or education modules to meet the needs of different populations or communities included a toolkit for people suffering from spinal cord injuries and disease Dr Rachel Buckley the development of a fall prevention program for senior citizens Dr Judy ChalouhBenjamin a protocol using mindfulness and leisure for adults with disabilities Dr Gavi Gordon and a culturally informed aginginplace program for underserved adults Dr Ebony SneedKnight

Machine Learning Methods in Consumer Lending
Faculty Leads
 Philip Kalikman principal investigator and assistant professor of finance and real estate 
 Andy Catlin director and clinical assistant professor 
 Brandon Chiazza industry professor 
Artificial intelligence and machine learning models have increasingly been used to determine eligibility and interest rates for consumer debt However existing research on the adoption of these technologies is limited due to lack of model transparency
This project aims to implement a modern neural network model of consumer credit performance and compare the model against an existing structural model These findings will have broad implications for how fintech and mainstream lenders build and deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning models and for the trilliondollar consumer credit industry more broadly

Improving Commercial Success of Innovations Led by Women in STEM
Faculty Lead
 Lorraine Marchand industry professor 
The number of women entrepreneurs in STEM lags far behind the number of men Only 20 of Fortune 500 chief innovation officers are women women founders represent 23 of venture capital investments women make up 23 of venture capital partners and there is a 16 gender wage gap among STEM professionals Half as many women as men are likely to start their own business and 95 of women who do start their own business fail within a year because they cant secure funding and other necessary support
In this project Lorraine Marchand will work with women entrepreneurs in the early stages of their technology startups She will implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach described in her book The Innovation Mindset Eight Essential Steps for Transforming Any Industry as well as her Resource Guide for Women Innovators to increase the chances of commercial success for women innovators in STEM The work is intended to raise the profile and number of women entrepreneurs in STEM and to demonstrate that women innovators can raise funds and experience commercial success by following a structured process and with appropriate coaching and support
